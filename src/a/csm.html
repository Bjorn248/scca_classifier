        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            If a change or modification is not specifically authorized, it is not allowed.
            All repairs must comply with factory-authorized methods and
            procedures, or industry standard methods, as follows: If the manufacturer does not
            provide an appropriate method of repair, industry
            standard methods and procedures may be used. Such repairs may not
            result in a part or combination of parts that provides a performance
            advantage (e.g., significant change to weight, suspension control, power, etc.) as
            compared to the standard part(s). Competitors are strongly
            cautioned to use this allowance to make common-sense repairs only.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wheel lug studs (e.g., length) and lug nuts may be changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Components which are normally expendable and considered replacement parts may be
            used provided they are essentially identical to the
            standard parts, used in the same location, and provide no performance
            benefit. Examples are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                a. Clutch and related components (excluding flywheel).
              </li>
              <li>
                b. Hardware (nuts, bolts, clips, etc.)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Parts superseded by Ford® may be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            These allowances are strictly to permit components to be replaced from
            alternate sources other than the original manufacturer. They should
            not be construed as an allowance to replace components with those
            which could be considered a "higher performance" alternative.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is not permitted to use non-compliant parts even if they have been set
            to the manufacturer's specifications.

            The engine management system parameters and operation of internal
            combustion engines may be modified only via the methods listed below.
            <ul>
              <li>
                OE ECU software may be reprogramed, but no changes to the factory ECU hardware are permitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any OE OBD2 or newer communications port functionality must remain.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Oil filters are unrestricted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lubricants and fluids are unrestricted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fuel must be Federally approved for use on public highways and widely
            distributed and typically sold in filling stations, commonly called "pump
            fuel" with typical octane ratings or AKI (Anti-Knock Index) (R+M/2)
            displayed on the pump between 87 and 93. The maximum octane rating
            allowed is what is typically delivered from a pump marked 93 octane*.
            </li>
          <li>
            Fuels comprised of more than 15% ethanol may only be used when
            specified by the manufacturer (e.g., in the owner's manual for flex-fuel vehicles).
          </li>
          <li>
            Octane verification: Octane levels will vary from the number listed on
            the pump. Octane testing has a "margin of error" and different testing
            procedures will produce similar but different results. For the purposes
            of testing gasoline, a result that exceeds 95.9 octane is not allowed and
            will result in a disqualification with no exceptions (hard limit). This
            limit gives competitors a 99.99+% confidence level that fuel purchased
            from a pump marked 93 octane is compliant. Warning: Competitors
            attempting to approach the 95.9 octane limit through mixing or by any
            other means may inadvertently create fuel that appears compliant but
            may test above the 95.9 hard limit.
