            Street Prepared vehicles may only be modified in excess of Street Category rules in
            the following ways. Any modification not specifically authorized by the Street
            Category or Street Prepared rules is prohibited. No unauthorized modifications are
            permitted in order to accommodate authorized modifications (e.g., non-standard hood
            scoops or holes necessary for carburetor clearance). Structural modifications, such
            as the addition of members known as "jacking rails," are not permitted unless
            specifically authorized herein

            updating/backdating allowance. Standard factory installation methods, locations, and
            configurations are allowed. The updating and/or backdating of engines,
            transmissions, transaxles, and/or unibodies must be done as a unit; component parts
            and specifications of these units may not be interchanged. Cars not listed in the
            Street Prepared Sections of Appendix A may not be updated/backdated until approved by
            the SEB and published in the official SCCA® publication.

          15.2 BODYWORK
Vehicles may only exceed the allowances of Street Category section 13.2 as
specified herein.</br></br>A. Full Prep:</br> Fenders and bumpers may be modified for tire clearance.
This includes the portion of a hood which serves as a fender/wheel well,
where applicable. This does not permit modifications to the chassis
or bodywork inboard of the vertical plane of the hub/wheel mounting
face (at rest, with front wheels straight ahead). Flares may be added
although tires may extend beyond the bodywork. Replacement of complete hood, flared fenders, or quarter panels is prohibited. Plastic and
rubber wheel well splash shields may be modified or removed for tire
clearance and for installation of fender flares as allowed herein.
Hardware may be added to the steering system outside the passenger
compartment to limit steering travel, provided it does not alter steering
or suspension geometry within the limited range of motion and serves
no other purpose.
Limited Prep:</br> Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may
be rolled to gain additional tire clearance. (The outer fender contour
may not be changed.) Plastic and rubber wheel well splash shields may
be modified for tire clearance and to accommodate a rolled inside fender lip. The modifications may serve no other purpose (e.g., air intake,



brake ducts, etc.). No other changes to the standard fenders or wheel
wells are permitted.</br></br>B. Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, rear wings, and/or spoilers
may be removed.</br></br>C. Strut bars (per Section 12.18) are permitted with all types of suspensions, subject to the following constraints:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted,
but only with another two-point strut bar.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or substituted; substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point strut
bar. The connection to the chassis (i.e., firewall, bulkhead) must be in
the standard location.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension
pickup point locations on the chassis within two inches (2&#34;, 50.8 mm)
in any direction of the actual suspension attachment to the chassis.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Except for standard parts, no connections to other components are permitted.
Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts. Interior trim panels
may be modified to allow installation of strut bars. Holes or slots may
be no larger than necessary and may serve no other purpose. This does
not permit any modifications to the frame or unibody beyond the allowed mounting holes.</div></br></br>D. Full Prep:</br> Subframe mount bushings may be replaced, but must attach
in the standard location(s) without additional modification or changes.
Subframe position may not be changed.</br></br>E. Longitudinal (fore-aft) subframe connectors (SFCs) are permitted with
the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. They must only connect previously unconnected boxed frame rails on
unibody vehicles.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Each SFC must attach at no more than three points on the unibody
(e.g., front, rear, and one point in between such as a seat mount brace
or rocker box brace).</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Full Prep:</br> SFCs must be bolted or welded, but welding must be to the
OE subframe stampings, not to the floor pan in between.
Limited Prep:</br> SFCs must be bolted.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. No cutting of OE subframes or floorpan stampings is permitted. Drilling is permitted for mounting bolts only.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. No cross-car/lateral/triangulated connections directly between the
driver&#39;s side and passenger&#39;s side SFCs are permitted. Connections to
OE components such as tunnel braces or closure panels via bolts are
allowed and count as the third point of attachment. No alteration to the
OE components is permitted.
</div><div class="indent"></br>6. SFCs may not be used to attach other components (including but not
limited to torque arm front mounts or driveshaft loops) and may serve
no other purpose.</div></br></br>F. The driver and front passenger seats may be replaced with the following restrictions:</br> Seats must be securely mounted per Section 3.3.3.B.3.
The seating surface must be fully upholstered. Any replacement seat
must be a full back, bucket-type automobile seat incorporating a functional headrest. Kart seats, low-back dune buggy seats, and other similar types of seat are expressly prohibited. Cars may have no fewer than
the standard number of seats. The seat tracks are considered part of the
seat and may be substituted. Alternate seat tracks may serve no other
purpose. The standard seat belts may be removed to facilitate the installation of alternate restraints complying with safety requirements. An
alternate seat which replaces an airbag-equipped seat is not required to
have an airbag.</br></br>G. Any steering wheel may be used. An alternate wheel which replaces an
airbag-equipped wheel is not required to have an airbag. An alternate
wheel is not required to have a horn button.</br></br>H. Airbags may be electrically disabled but not removed unless explicitly
allowed.</br></br>I. Full Prep:</br> Spoilers/splitters and cosmetic trim pieces are permitted.
Side skirts may not be used. Spoilers/splitters must comply with the
following:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. A spoiler/splitter may be added to the front of the car below the bumper. It may not extend rearward beyond the front most part of the front
wheel well openings, and may not block normal grille or other openings, or obstruct lights. Splitters may not protrude beyond the bumper
as viewed from above. Openings may not be used for the purpose of
ducting air to the radiator or oil cooler, but they may allow air to flow
through a permitted oil cooler provided no ducting is used. The spoiler
may not function as a wing. This allows a vertical air dam/spoiler above
a horizontal splitter, but splitter fences or longitudinal vertical members that serve to trap air on top of the splitter by preventing it from
flowing around the sides of the car are not allowed.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. A spoiler may be added to the rear of the car provided it complies with
either of the following:</br>
a. It is a production rear spoiler which is standard or optional equipment of a US model of the vehicle or an exact replica in an alternate material.
b. It is a non-production rear spoiler which is mounted to the rearmost portion of the rear hatch, deck, trunk lid, or bodywork. The
spoiler may extend no more than 10&#34; (254 mm) from the original bodywork in any direction. Alternatively, in a hatchback, the
spoiler may be mounted to the rear hatch lid at or near the top of
the hatch; in such a configuration the spoiler may extend no more



than 4&#34; (101.6 mm) from the original bodywork in any direction.
The spoiler shall not protrude beyond the perimeter of the original bodywork as viewed from above. The use of endplates is prohibited. Angle of attack is free. The spoiler may not function as a
wing.
Limited Prep:</br> Addition of spoilers, splitters, rear wings, bumper covers, valances, side skirts, and non-functional scoops/vents is allowed
provided that either:</br></div><div class="indent"></br>1. It is a production part which is standard or optional equipment of a US
model of the vehicle. (&#34;Model&#34; is defined in Section 12.)</div><div class="indent"></br>2. It is listed in the vehicle manufacturer&#39;s US accessory catalog for that
vehicle for normal highway use. This does not allow for parts sold
through a manufacturer&#39;s performance catalog (e.g., Ford Racing, HPD,
MazdaSpeed, Mopar Performance, Mugen, NISMO, SPT, TRD, etc.).
Parts must be installed as directed by the manufacturer. Exact replicas,
including weight, from alternate sources are also permitted.</div></br></br>J. Rollover structures<div class="indent"></br>1. Roll bars must comply with Section 13.2.G.1 in Street category.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Roll cages must comply with the following:</br>
a. The roll cage need not be removable. It shall be bolted or welded to the
car.
b. The cage shall attach to the car at no more than 8 points, consisting of the basic cage with 6 attachment points and 2 additional
optional braces.
c. The forward part of the cage shall be mounted to the floor of the
vehicle. If used, the 2 optional braces referred to in (2) shall be
mounted, one on either side, from the forward section of the cage
to the firewall or front fender wells. No braces shall pass through
the front firewall.
d. Roll cages that utilize NASCAR-style door bars that protrude into
the door cavity must comply with the GCR roll cage requirements
for production-based cars.
e. Roll cages which utilize door bars that protrude into the door panel must comply with all Club Racing GCR requirements for roll
cages.
Installation of roll cages in Street Prepared cars must follow the same
standards for interior modifications to accommodate the cage installation as those which are applicable to Touring cars in Club Racing.</div></br></br>K. Full Prep:</br> The use of a fuel cell which complies with GCR requirements is permitted, provided all of the following additional restrictions
are met:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. The capacity of the cell may differ by no more than 20% from that of the
original tank.
</div><div class="indent"></br>2. The location of the cell may differ from that of the original tank by no
more than 6&#34; in any direction.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. The car meets all applicable Club Racing Time Trials Level 3 Track Trials and/or Level 4 Hillclimbs safety standards, including those for rollover protection and the installation of a fire extinguisher.</div></br></br>L. Full Prep:</br> Fuel tank changes are permitted only as allowed under Sections 15.1.C and 15.2.K. No additional tanks or reservoirs may be used.</br></br>M.Accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals may utilize substitute covers of
unrestricted origin, shape, and size provided they meet the following
requirements:</br> covers must be securely attached, provide a non-slip surface, not interfere with each other&#39;s operation, and must be deemed safe
at Tech Inspection. A clutch pedal stop may be added.</br></br>N. Full Prep:</br> The OE radio may be removed. The OE sound system components, except wiring, may be removed. Any visible holes which result
from the removal of such equipment must be covered.</br></br>O. Full Prep:</br> Sunroof-equipped cars may be converted to a solid-roof
configuration provided a model without a sunroof is listed on the same
line in Appendix A.</br></br>P. Full Prep:</br> A non-OE sunroof replacement panel may not be used in
place of the OE sunroof.</br></br>Q. Fog lights may be removed.</br></br>R. Full Prep:</br> Interior rear view mirror and sun visors (and mounting
hardware provided it serves no other purpose) may be removed or replaced.</br></br>S. Suspension and drivetrain mounting, including subframes, locations
may be reinforced in order to improve durability and reliability. Any
modifications are subject to the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Material may only be added, not removed.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Mounting locations may not be moved in any direction.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. The method of attachment to other components may not be changed.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Any added material may not inhibit any motion that would otherwise
be uninhibited.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Any modification must remain in the area of the attachment point to be
reinforced. This does not allow for braces or cross connection between
otherwise unconnected locations.</div></br>6. Modifications may serve no purpose other than to increase durability
and reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without
improving performance. Modifications are not to be made to allow for
increased power or larger tires but to fix or prevent common failures
of the vehicle structure or subframes. This rule is intended to permit
modifications to prevent common failures such as suspension mounting location tear-outs or cracking shock towers/subframes.

shock absorbers shall be the same as standard. No shock absorber may
be capable of adjustment while the car is in motion unless fitted as original equipment. MacPherson strut equipped cars may substitute struts
and/or may use any insert. This does not allow unauthorized changes
in suspension geometry or changes in attachment points (e.g., affecting
the position of the lower ball joint or spindle). It is intended to allow the
strut length changes needed to accommodate permitted modifications
which affect ride height and suspension travel. This allowance differs
from the Club Racing Improved Touring Allowance 9.1.3.D.5.b.1.</br></br>D. On strut suspensions using a non-standard lower control arm (as defined by Section 15.8.H.2), an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or

          15.8 SUSPENSION
Vehicles may only exceed the allowances of Section 13.8 as specified herein.</br></br>A. Ride height may only be altered by suspension adjustments, the use
of spacing blocks, leaf spring shackles, torsion bar levers, or change or
modification of springs or coil spring perches. This does not allow the
use of spacers which alter suspension geometry such as those between
the hub carrier and lower suspension arm. Springs must be of the same
type as the original (coil, leaf, torsion bar, etc.) and except as noted
herein, must use the original spring attachment points. This permits
multiple springs as long as they use the original mount locations. Coil
spring perches originally attached to struts or shock absorber bodies
may be changed or altered and their position may be adjustable. Spacers are allowed above or below the spring.</br></br>B. Suspension bump stops may be altered or removed.</br></br>C. Suspension bushings may be replaced with bushings of any materials
as long as they fit in the original location. Offset bushings may be used.
Bushing type may be changed to alternate types (e.g. spherical bearing).
Pins or keys may be used to prevent the rotation of alternate bushings
but may serve no other purpose than that of retaining the bushing in the
desired position. Differential mount bushings are not considered to be
suspension bushings and are not covered by this allowance.</br></br>D. Differential mount bushings may be replaced but must attach in the
factory location(s) without additional modification or changes. Differential position may not be changed.</br></br>E. Steering rack bushings may be replaced but must attach in the factory
location(s) without additional modification or changes. Steering rack
position may not be changed. Solid metal bushings are specifically prohibited. This does NOT allow shimming or otherwise relocating the
steering rack.</br></br>F. The following allowances apply to strut-type suspensions:</br> Adjustable

camber plates may be installed at the top of the strut and the original
upper mounting holes may be slotted. The drilling of holes in order to
perform the installation is permitted but the center clearance hole may
not be modified. Any type of bearing or bushing may be used in the adjustable camber plate attachment to the strut. The installation may incorporate an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block
(bearing mount). Any ride height change resulting from installation of
camber plates is allowed. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber plates are permitted.</br></br>G. Camber bolts may be installed providing these parts use the original,
unmodified mounting points. Caster changes resulting from the use of
camber bolts are permitted.</br></br>H. Camber kits, also known as camber compensators, may be installed.
These kits consist of either adjustable length arms, arm mounts, or ball
joints that provide a lateral adjustment to the effective length of a control arm. Alignment outside the factory specifications is allowed. Caster
changes resulting from the use of camber kits are permitted. The following restrictions apply:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. On double/unequal arm (e.g., wishbone, multi-link) suspensions, only
the upper arms OR lower arms may be modified or replaced, but not
both. Non-integral longitudinal arms that primarily control fore/aft
wheel movement (e.g., trailing arm(s) or link(s) of a multi-link suspension) may not be replaced, changed, or modified.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. On arm-and-strut (MacPherson/Chapman) suspensions, the lower
arms may be modified/replaced OR other methods of camber adjustment as allowed by Sections 15.8.C, F, or G may be used, but NOT both.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. On swing or trailing arm suspensions, the main arms may not be modified or replaced but lateral locating links/arms may be modified or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. The replacement arms or mounts must attach to the original standard
mounting points. All bushings must meet the requirements of Section
15.8.C. Intermediate mounting points (e.g., shock/spring mounts) may
not be moved or relocated on the arm, except as incidental to the camber adjustment. The knuckle/bearing housing/spindle assembly cannot
be modified or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Changes in suspension geometry are not allowed except as incidental to
the effective arm length change.
Note:</br> Many modern suspension designs known by other names actually function as double A-arm designs. These include the rear suspensions on 88+ Honda Civic/Integra, Dodge/Plymouth Neon, BMW E36,
and most &#34;multi-link&#34; and are covered by Section 15.8.H.1.</div></br></br>I. Solid axle suspension allowances:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Addition or replacement of suspension stabilizers (linkage connecting
the axle housing or De Dion to the chassis, which controls lateral sus


pension location) is permitted.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Traction bars or torque arms may be added or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. A panhard rod may be added or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. The upper arm(s) may be removed, replaced, or modified and the upper
pickup points on the rear axle housing may be relocated.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. The lower arms may be replaced or modified and the lower pickup points
on the rear axle housing may be relocated.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Differential covers and attaching hardware may be replaced.
Methods of attachment and attachment points are unrestricted, but
may serve no other purpose (e.g., chassis stiffening). This does not authorize removal of a welded-on part of a subframe or bodywork to accommodate the installation.</div></br></br>J. On strut-equipped cars, the strut&#39;s lower integral mounting bracket, for
attachment to the upright or spindle, is unrestricted provided it attaches to the standard location. Any resulting change to the position of the
strut centerline is allowed. Such brackets shall serve no other purpose.
This does not allow for changes to the integral steering arm on cars that
have the steering arm integrated with the strut body.</br></br>K. Changes in alignment parameters which result directly from the use
of allowed components are permitted. For example, the dimensional
changes resulting from the use of a cylindrical offset bushing which
meets the restrictions of Section 15.8.C are allowed, including those resulting from a change in the pivoting action to<div class="indent"></br>1. About the mounting bolt, or</div><div class="indent"></br>2. About the bushing itself.
Eccentric bolts are permitted for suspension adjustment only if they are
as specified by the factory, per the last paragraph of Section 13.8.</div></br></br>L. Suspension components may be replaced with aftermarket components
in order to improve durability and reliability. Any replaced components
are subject to the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Replacement components may not be lighter than the original component.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Replacement components must install without modification to the mating part.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Replacement components may not differ from the original beyond improved strength, alternate manufacturing techniques, or replacement
with larger components.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Components around or connected to the replaced component may not
be relocated or modified unless permitted elsewhere in section 15.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Heat treatment may be used to increase the durability of an original
part and the resulting part will be considered a replaced component.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Metal components may not be replaced with non-metal components.

However a non-metal component may be replaced with a metal component so long as this does not violate other rules. For example the bushing metal content rule still applies.</div><div class="indent"></br>7. Replaced components may not alter the suspension geometry unless
otherwise permitted in section 15. Replacement hubs may relocate the
wheel mating surface to widen the track width but may not relocate the
wheel mating surface to narrow the track width.</div><div class="indent"></br>8. Replaced components may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability
without improving performance. Components are not to be replaced to
allow for increased power or larger tires but to replace common component failures. For example, hubs often become wear items that require
frequent replacement to avoid failure. Hubs may be replaced with larger, stronger hubs to reduce the chance of failure and increase the life of
the component.</div></br></br>M.For cars originally equipped with transverse leaf springs, spring type
may be changed to a coil spring. Spring perches may be added to shock
absorbers for mounting coil springs in a &#34;coilover&#34; configuration.</br></br>N. Lateral suspension links which serve to control toe may be modified
or replaced to facilitate toe adjustment, provided the factory mounting
locations are used without modification. Factory adjustment mechanisms such as eccentric bolts may be locked out or otherwise disabled.
Changes in suspension geometry are not allowed except as incidental
to the effective arm length change. On double/unequal arm (e.g. wishbone) suspensions 15.8.H.1 or 15.8.N may be used to change one arm
but not both.

unit. Any generator or alternator pulley and belt of the same type as
standard may be used (see Section 15.10.Y).</br></br>E. Wiring harnesses may not be removed in whole or in part. Wiring connectors for emissions control devices are considered part of the harness, not part of the emissions control system, and may not be removed.
Connectors may be changed for compatibility with allowed aftermarket
components such as ignition coils. Pigtails may be used.</br></br>F. A hole may be drilled in the firewall to permit passage of electrical wiring. It should be no larger than necessary and shall serve no other purpose.

15.10 ENGINE AND DRIVETRAIN

Vehicles may only exceed the allowances of Section 13.10 as specified herein. Powertrains may not be modified in fully-electric vehicles. Vehicles
with hybrid powertrains may only modify the internal combustion portion
of the powertrain as described below; the high voltage side of the powertrain may not be modified</br></br>A. Engines must retain standard type lubricating system, but may have
any oil pan (Accusump®-type systems allowed), oil pump and pickup,
oil cooler(s), or oil or fuel filters. Fuel filters must be of automotive type
and may serve no other purpose; a substituted fuel filter may not be
used as a reservoir. Substituted fuel filters may not exceed one quart
total capacity. A permitted oil cooler may be positioned in an opening in
an allowed spoiler, provided no unauthorized modifications are made
in order to perform the installation. Any power steering fluid cooler
may be added.</br></br>B. Heat shields may be added.</br></br>C. Induction allowances are as follows:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Fuel injection systems and carburetors are unrestricted, including
throttle bodies, manifolds, and plumbing/piping between the inlet port
at the cylinder head and the atmosphere, subject to 15.10.C.4. Alternate
throttle linkage and connections to facilitate installation of allowed induction systems are permitted but may serve no other purpose. If an
induction system item is allowed to be removed and its original mounting bracket can be removed by simply unbolting it, the bracket may be
removed as well.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Except for standard parts as defined in these rules, the external use
while on course of liquids, ice, dry ice, refrigeration systems, vaporized compressed gases, etc. to reduce the temperature of the intake air
charge is prohibited. Wrapping of intakes with liquid-soaked fabric is
not permitted.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. As utilized only on engines originally equipped with forced induction,
induction charge heat exchangers (also known as &#34;intercoolers&#34; or

&#34;charge air coolers&#34; [CACs]) are unrestricted in size and configuration.
Air-to-air CACs and radiators for air-to-liquid CACs must be cooled
only by the atmosphere except for standard parts. Body panels, fascias,
or structural members may not be cut or altered to facilitate CAC installation.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Turbochargers and/or superchargers (forced induction) may not be
added, changed, or modified (this does not allow ceramic coating of
turbochargers). On vehicles originally equipped with forced induction:</br>
a. No hardware changes or alterations to turbocharger(s) or
supercharger(s), in size or number, are permitted. Turbochargers
or superchargers may be updated/backdated only in conjunction
with the accompanying complete engine unit.
b. No changes are allowed to waste gate(s), number, or location.
Wastegate openings may be modified by removing material to
increase flow through the wastegate. No material may be added
and no other modifications to the wastegate are authorized. This
does not allow removal of any material to increase airflow into,
through or out of the turbocharger&#39;s turbine or compressor housings. No changes are allowed to variable-geometry turbine (VGT)
hardware.
c. Supercharger pulleys and belts of the same type as standard may
be replaced with alternate pulleys allowing drive ratio changes.
Belt tensioners may be added/changed to reduce belt slip.
d. Compressor bypass valves (CBVs), blow-off valves, and pop-off
valves are considered part of the air intake system and may be
added, replaced, or updated/backdated independently of the other components of a forced induction system.
e. Boost regulation systems, either electronic or mechanical, and
electronic fuel cuts referencing boost pressure may be altered or
modified except as prohibited herein. Boost pressure changes resulting from authorized changes are permitted.</div></br></br>D. Traction and/or stability control systems, as defined in Section 12.12,
must be standard parts at standard settings or electronically disabled.</br></br>E. Air cleaner(s) may be changed or removed; velocity stacks may be added.</br></br>F. Emission control devices may be modified or removed. This permits
the oil filler cap to be modified or substituted but does not allow valve
covers or cam covers to be altered to install a breather or for any other
purpose.</br></br>G. Intake water injection systems are allowed.</br></br>H. Fuel lines and pumps are unrestricted except as specified herein, as long
as they do not pose a safety hazard. Fuel lines may be no larger than ½&#34;
(12.7 mm) i.d. (inside diameter) and may only connect to the original
fuel tank or allowed fuel cell. They may be no longer than necessary for



reasonable and safe installation, and may serve no other purpose. A
single fuel feed line may be used. A single fuel return line may be used
and a fitting for connecting it may be added at or near the top of the fuel
tank. This does not authorize &#34;cool-cans.&#34;</br></br>I. Exhaust manifolds and muffler systems are free, except that they must
be quiet and terminate behind the driver (Section 3.3.3.B.16). Exhaust
heat shields may be removed. Rear- and mid-engine cars without exhaust headers/manifold systems may use any exhaust system that
meets the requirements of Section 3.5. This permits the removal of
&#34;heater boxes&#34; in order to install headers on such cars.</br></br>J. Engine and transmission mounts may be replaced but must attach in
the factory location(s) without additional modification or changes. Engine position may not be changed. Hydraulic shock type rear engine
locators, or bobble struts, may be replaced by manufacturer&#39;s performance part or aftermarket replacement part. This part must retain factory dimensions and attachment points, including factory design. (Example:</br> If factory locator/bobble strut is gas or hydraulic piston type,
replacement part must be gas or hydraulic piston type.) If one or more
non-OE engine or transmission mounts are used, Section 15.10.K does
not apply and a torque suppression device may not be used.</br></br>K. One bolt-on torque suppression device may be used. A torque suppression device attaches from the engine to the body, frame, or subframe
in one location and controls engine movement at that location along a
single axis only. It may serve no other purpose.
Examples of permitted devices:</br>
• A chain
• A rod with spherical bearings at each end
Examples of devices not permitted:</br>
• Any link which confines movement along more than one axis.
• An engine mounting plate, or one or more plates rigidly bolted between the engine and the frame. Holes may be drilled to mount a
torque suppression device. The installation may not include the
welding of any plate(s) to the bodywork or to the motor mount(s)
nor may it include multiple non-parallel links.
If a torque suppression device is used, Section 15.10.J does not apply
and replacement engine mounts may not be used.</br></br>L. Engine cooling radiators may be replaced with alternate parts subject to
the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Radiator dimensions (width, height, thickness, etc.) must be no smaller
than the standard part.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Radiator must mount to OE radiator mounts.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Fluid capacity and dry weight of the radiator must be no less than that
of the standard part. Installation of an alternate radiator may serve no

other purpose (e.g., to allow a cold air intake passage).</div></br></br>M.The engine fan and fan shroud (unless it serves another purpose, e.g., as
an alternator/generator mount) may be removed, modified or replaced.
Electrically driven fans are allowed. Flex fans are not allowed.</br></br>N. On two-cycle engines, the ports must be of standard heights, size and
configuration; crankcase volume and reed plates must not be altered.</br></br>O. Full Prep:</br> Any metal clutch assembly, metal flywheel, or metal torque
converter that uses the standard attachment to the crankshaft may be
used. Non-metallic friction surfaces (e.g., clutch discs) are permitted.
Dowel pins may be added. Any hydraulic clutch line may be used. Replacement or substitution of the clutch master cylinder and clutch slave
cylinder is permitted.
Limited Prep:</br> Any metal clutch assembly, metal flywheel, or metal
torque converter that uses the standard attachment to the crankshaft
may be used. Non-metallic friction surfaces (e.g., clutch disks) are permitted. Dowel pins may be added. Any hydraulic clutch line may be
used. Replacement or substitution of the clutch slave cylinder is permitted. Clutch/Flywheel friction surface diameter must be the same as
original equipment.</br></br>P. Any mechanical shift linkage may be used.</br></br>Q. Limited slip differentials are permitted. This permits locked differentials either by design, welding, or mechanical means. Differential cases,
internal differential parts, and axle stubs may be machined as required
for clearance and installation to the extent that material may only be
removed, not added, and the exterior of the case may not be altered in
any way. This machining may serve no other purpose. Any other modifications or substitutions to accommodate the installation of the limited slip differential must meet the requirements of Section 15.1.B and
15.1.C.</br></br>R. Full Prep:</br> Cylinders may be rebored to no more than 0.0472&#34; (1.20
mm) over standard bore and the appropriate standard oversize piston
may be substituted. This overbore dimension is an absolute limit; no
additional tolerance is permitted to accommodate wear. Cast or forged,
non-standard pistons of the same dimensions and configuration as
original equipment pistons may be used. Additionally the replacement
pistons must be of the same weight or greater as the original equipment
pistons. Replacement pistons must match OE piston configuration exactly including quench area. The allowance for the use of aftermarket
forgings vs. OE castings does not permit alternate piston dome designs.
This allowance does not permit alternative ring configurations.</br></br>S. Full Prep:</br> Rotating and reciprocating parts may be balanced but not
lightened.</br></br>T. Full Prep:</br> Intake and exhaust ports and manifold openings may be
matched provided no change is made more than one inch from the port/
manifold interface. Material may be removed to facilitate port match


ing, but no material may be added.</br></br>U. Any transmission and/or differential oil coolers may be used. Differential covers may be modified or substituted for cooling.</br></br>V. The engine cylinder head(s) may be milled only to that amount specified in the manufacturer&#39;s workshop manual. If no amount is specified
then a maximum of 0.010&#34; (0.254 mm) may be milled.</br></br>W.Axle/halfshaft and driveshaft retention/location devices may be installed for safety reasons to control the motion of attached shafts upon
the failure of a coupling or universal joint. They may serve no other
purpose. This allowance does not include &#34;C-clip eliminators.&#34;</br></br>X. Any crankshaft damper or pulley may be used. SFI-rated dampers are
recommended.</br></br>Y. Any accessory pulleys and belts of the same type (e.g., V-belt, serpentine) as standard may be used. This allowance applies to accessory
pulleys only (e.g., alternator, water pump, power steering pump, and
crankshaft drive pulleys). Alternate pulley materials may be used. Idler
pulleys may be used for belt routing in place of items which the rules
specifically allow to be removed such as smog pumps and air conditioning compressors. They may serve no other purpose.</br></br>Z. Camshafts and related parts must remain standard except that alternate cam drive pulleys or gears may be used to adjust cam timing if
no variable cam and/or valve timing system exists as standard. Timing covers or valve covers may be altered for pulley clearance or access to adjustment. Type of cam drive (chain, belt, gear) must remain as
standard. Alternate parts of the same general type (e.g., roller chain in
place of &#34;silent&#34; chain) may be substituted. Mating parts (block, heads,
covers, retainers, etc.) may not be altered except as mentioned above.
Vehicles equipped with a variable cam and/or valve timing system as
standard may use alternate computer calibration to adjust cam and/or
valve timing but may not change or substitute cam drive components
(hardware).
AA. Upper engine shields made of plastic material, the purpose of which
is to hide mechanical components in the engine compartment, may be
removed if they have a solely aesthetic and/or acoustic function.
BB. Cruise control systems may be removed in whole or part.
CC. Engine oil tanks for dry sump lubrication systems may be replaced
with alternate parts subject to the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Fluid capacity and dry weight of the oil tank must be no less than that of
the standard part.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Oil tank must mount in the OE location.
DD. Drivetrain components may be replaced with aftermarket components in order to improve durability and reliability. Any replaced components are subject to the following restrictions:</br></div><div class="indent"></br>1. Replacement components may not be lighter than the original compo
nent.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Replacement components must install without modification to the mating part.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Replacement components may not differ from the original beyond improved strength, alternate manufacturing techniques, or replacement
with larger components.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Components around or connected to the replaced component may not
be relocated or modified unless permitted elsewhere in section 15.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Internal engine components such as pistons, connecting rods, or valve
train components may not be replaced under this rule.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Heat treatment may be used to increase the durability of an original
part and the resulting part will be considered a replaced component.</div><div class="indent"></br>7. Metal components may not be replaced with non-metal components.
However a non-metal component may be replaced with a metal component.</div></br>8. Replaced components may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability
without improving performance. Components are not to be replaced to
allow for increased power or larger tires but to replace common component failures. For example, axle shafts or CV joints are often broken on
launch. Under this rule these may be replaced with larger components
or components made of stronger materials to avoid these breakages.
Alternatively a vehicle may not replace a turbocharger with a larger or
stronger part as this would increase the performance potential of the
vehicle.
EE. Cars with combustion chamber oil injection systems (such as those in
rotary engines) may supplement the standard engine lubrication system
with additional oil supplied through the standard fuel delivery system.
FF. The Transmission Control Unit (TCU) may be re-programmed. This
allowance only applies to modification of transmission behaviors and
does not extend to re-programming any other components.
GG. Electronic differentials may be re-programmed. This allowance only
applies to changing differential behaviors and does not extend to reprogramming any other components.
HH. Cars with combustion chamber oil injection systems (such as those in
rotary engines) may supplement the standard engine lubrication with
additional oil supplied through the standard fuel delivery system and/
or an oil-metering-pump (OMP) adaptor plate. An oil storage tank may
be added to provide oil to the OMP. Holes may be drilled for mounting

Where a car is out of production and the manufacturer is either out of



business, stocks no parts, or no longer has a required part, a part of any
origin but as similar as possible to the original may be substituted. The
entrant must be prepared to show documentary evidence that one of the
three circumstances above applies and that the substituted part is as similar as possible under the circumstances. Substitute parts which provide
improvements in performance (e.g., superior gearing, lighter weight, better camshaft profile) are not permitted under this allowance.
