        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            All Allowable modifications permitted in Section 13, Street Category are allowed
          </li>
          <li>
            Street Prepared vehicles may only be modified in excess of Street Category rules in
            the following ways. Any modification not specifically authorized by the Street
            Category or Street Prepared rules is prohibited. No unauthorized modifications are
            permitted in order to accommodate authorized modifications (e.g., non-standard hood
            scoops or holes necessary for carburetor clearance). Structural modifications, such
            as the addition of members known as "jacking rails," are not permitted unless
            specifically authorized herein
          </li>
          <li>
            Full Prep: Equipment and/or specifications may be exchanged between different years
            and models of a vehicle if:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The item is standard on the year/model from which it was taken, and
              </li>
              <li>
                The years/models are listed on the same line of Appendix A, Street Prepared Classes
              </li>
            </ul>
            The updated/backdated part or the part to which it is to be attached may not be
            altered, modified, machined, welded, or otherwise changed to facilitate the
            updating/backdating allowance. Standard factory installation methods, locations, and
            configurations are allowed. The updating and/or backdating of engines,
            transmissions, transaxles, and/or unibodies must be done as a unit; component parts
            and specifications of these units may not be interchanged. Cars not listed in the
            Street Prepared Sections of Appendix A may not be updated/backdated until approved by
            the SEB and published in the official SCCA® publication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternate computer control modules may be used whenever an equivalent change to the
            conventional system is allowed. For example, alternate computer module control of
            ignition settings or fuel injection is allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air conditioning systems may be removed in whole or in part. This rule should not be
            interpreted to allow modification of the heater system.
          </li>
          <li>
            On all forms of suspension, camber/caster adjustment within factory specifications may
            be achieved by the use of shims or eccentric bushings. The intent of this allowance
            is to permit cars to be restored to within factory-allowed specification ranges, not
            to provide an additional method beyond those permitted in Section 15.8, Suspension,
            to obtain alignment settings beyond the factory specifications. Refer to Appendix F
            for past clarifications of these rules

          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Full Prep: Fenders and bumpers may be modified for tire clearance. This includes
              the portion of a hood which serves as a fender/wheel well, where applicable. This
              does not permit modifications to the chassis or bodywork inboard of the vertical
              plane of the hub/wheel mounting face (at rest, with front wheels straight ahead).
              Flares may be added although tires may extend beyond the bodywork. Replacement of
              complete hood, flared fenders, or quarter panels is prohibited. Plastic and rubber
              wheel well splash shields may be modified or removed for tire clearance and for
              installation of fender flares as allowed herein
            </li>
            <li>
              Hardware may be added to the steering system outside the passenger compartment to
              limit steering travel, provided it does not alter steering or suspension geometry
              within the limited range of motion and serves no other purpose
            </li>
            <li>
              Limited Prep: Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may be rolled to
              gain additional tire clearance. (The outer fender contour may not be changed.)
              Plastic and rubber wheel well splash shields may be modified for tire clearance and
              to accommodate a rolled inside fender lip. The modifications may serve no other
              purpose (e.g., air intake, brake ducts, etc.). No other changes to the standard
              fenders or wheel wells are permitted
            </li>
            <li>
              Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, rear wings, and/or spoilers may be removed

            <li>
              Strut bars (per Section 12.18) are permitted with all types of suspensions,
              subject to the following constraints
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted, but only
                  with another two-point strut bar
                </li>
                <li>
                  A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or substituted;
                  substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point strut bar. The
                  connection to the chassis (i.e., firewall, bulkhead) must be in the standard
                  location
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension pickup point
                  locations on the chassis within two inches (2", 50.8 mm) in any direction of the
                  actual suspension attachment to the chassis
                </li>
                <li>
                  Except for standard parts, no connections to other components are permitted
                </li>
              </ul>
              Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts. Interior trim panels may be
              modified to allow installation of strut bars. Holes or slots may be no larger than
              necessary and may serve no other purpose. This does not permit any modifications to
              the frame or unibody beyond the allowed mounting holes
            </li>
            <li>
              Full Prep: Subframe mount bushings may be replaced, but must attach in the standard location(s)
              without additional modification or changes. Subframe position may not be
              changed
            </li>
            <li>
              Longitudinal (fore-aft) subframe connectors (SFCs) are permitted with the following
              restrictions
              <ul>
                <li>
                  They must only connect previously unconnected boxed frame rails on unibody
                  vehicles
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each SFC must attach at no more than three points on the unibody (e.g., front,
                  rear, and one point in between such as a seat mount brace or rocker box brace)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full Prep: SFCs must be bolted or welded, but welding must be to the OE subframe
                  stampings, not to the floor pan in between
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limited Prep: SFCs must be bolted
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cutting of OE subframes or floorpan stampings is permitted. Drilling is
                  permitted for mounting bolts only
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cross-car/lateral/triangulated connections directly between the driver's side
                  and passenger's side SFCs are permitted. Connections to OE components such as
                  tunnel braces or closure panels via bolts are allowed and count as the third
                  point of attachment. No alteration to the OE components is permitted
                </li>
                <li>
                  SFCs may not be used to attach other components (including but not limited to
                  torque arm front mounts or driveshaft loops) and may serve no other purpose
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The driver and front passenger seats may be replaced with the following
              restrictions: Seats must be securely mounted per Section 3.3.3.B.3. The seating
              surface must be fully upholstered. Any replacement seat must be a full back,
              bucket-type automobile seat incorporating a functional headrest. Kart seats,
              low-back dune buggy seats, and other similar types of seat are expressly
              prohibited. Cars may have no fewer than the standard number of seats. The seat
              tracks are considered part of the seat and may be substituted. Alternate seat tracks
              may serve no other purpose. The standard seat belts may be removed to facilitate the
              installation of alternate restraints complying with safety requirements. An
              alternate seat which replaces an airbag-equipped seat is not required to have an
              airbag
            </li>
            <li>
              Any steering wheel may be used. An alternate wheel which replaces an airbag-equipped
              wheel is not required to have an airbag. An alternate wheel is not required to have
              a horn button
            </li>
            <li>
              Airbags may be electrically disabled but not removed unless explicitly allowed
            </li>
            <li>
              Full Prep: Spoilers/splitters and cosmetic trim pieces are permitted. Side skirts
              may not be used. Spoilers/splitters must comply with the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A spoiler/splitter may be added to the front of the car below the bumper. It may
                  not extend rearward beyond the front most part of the front wheel well openings,
                  and may not block normal grille or other openings, or obstruct lights. Splitters
                  may not protrude beyond the bumper as viewed from above. Openings may not be
                  used for the purpose of ducting air to the radiator or oil cooler, but they may
                  allow air to flow through a permitted oil cooler provided no ducting is used.
                  The spoiler may not function as a wing. This allows a vertical air dam/spoiler
                  above a horizontal splitter, but splitter fences or longitudinal vertical
                  members that serve to trap air on top of the splitter by preventing it from
                  flowing around the sides of the car are not allowed
                </li>
                <li>
                  A spoiler may be added to the rear of the car provided it complies with either
                  of the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is a production rear spoiler which is standard or optional equipment of
                      a US model of the vehicle or an exact replica in an alternate material
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It is a non-production rear spoiler which is mounted to the rearmost
                      portion of the rear hatch, deck, or trunk lid. The spoiler may extend no
                      more than 10" (254 mm) from the original bodywork in any direction.
                      Alternatively, in a hatchback, the spoiler may be mounted to the rear hatch
                      lid at or near the top of the hatch; in such a configuration the spoiler may
                      extend no more than 4" (101.6 mm) from the original bodywork in any
                      direction. The spoiler shall not protrude beyond the perimeter of the
                      original bodywork as viewed from above. The use of endplates is prohibited.
                      Angle of attack is free. The spoiler may not function as a wing
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limited Prep: Addition of spoilers, splitters, rear wings, bumper covers,
                  valances, side skirts, and non-functional scoops/vents is allowed provided that
                  either:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is a production part which is standard or optional equipment of a US
                      model of the vehicle.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Any modification must remain in the area of the attachment point to be
                  reinforced. This does not allow for braces or cross connection between otherwise
                  unconnected locations

                <li>
                  Modifications may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and
                  reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without improving
                  performance. Modifications are not to be made to allow for increased power or
                  larger tires but to fix or prevent common failures of the vehicle structure or
                  subframes. This rule is intended to permit modifications to prevent common
                  failures such as suspension mounting location tear-outs or cracking shock

            Shock absorber bump stops may be altered or removed
          </li>
          <li>
            On cars with lever-type shock absorbers, a tube-type shock absorber may be added. If the
            lever-type shock serves no other purpose, it must be removed. If the lever-type shock
            serves any other purpose, it must be retained
          </li>
          <li>
            Any shock absorbers may be used. Shock absorber mounting brackets which serve no other
            purpose may be altered, added or replaced provided that the attachment points on the
            body/frame/subframe/chassis/ suspension member are not altered. The installation may
            incorporate an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block (bearing mount).
            The system of attachment may be changed. The number of shock absorbers shall be the same
            as standard. No shock absorber may be capable of adjustment while the car is in motion
            unless fitted as original equipment. MacPherson strut equipped cars may substitute
            struts and/or may use any insert. This does not allow unauthorized changes in suspension
            geometry or changes in attachment points (e.g., affecting the position of the lower ball
            joint or spindle). It is intended to allow the strut length changes needed to
            accommodate permitted modifications which affect ride height and suspension travel.
          </li>
          <li>
            On strut suspensions using a non-standard lower control arm (as defined by Section
            15.8.H.2), an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block (bearing mount) as
            described in Section 15.5.C may be used provided it offers no camber/caster adjustment
            beyond standard
          </li>
          <li>
            Substitution, addition, or removal of any anti-roll bar(s) is permitted. Bushing
            material, method of attachment, and locating points are unrestricted. This does not
            authorize removal of a welded-on part of a subframe to accommodate the installation,
            or the cutting of holes to route the bar or links. Non-standard lateral members which
            connect between the brackets for the bar, including allowed strut bars per Section
            15.2.C, are permitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bar may serve no other purpose which is not explicitly permitted elsewhere herein.
            Components such as anti-roll bars and strut housings which serve dual purposes by also
            functioning as suspension locators may not be modified or substituted in ways which
            change the suspension geometry or steering geometry, and may not be installed in
            positions (e.g., upside down) other than that of the original configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ride height may only be altered by suspension adjustments, the use of spacing blocks,
            leaf spring shackles, torsion bar levers, or change or modification of springs or coil
            spring perches. This does not allow the use of spacers which alter suspension geometry
            such as those between the hub carrier and lower suspension arm. Springs must be of the
            same type as the original (coil, leaf, torsion bar, etc.) and except as noted herein,
            must use the original spring attachment points. This permits multiple springs as long as
            they use the original mount locations. Coil spring perches originally attached to struts
            or shock absorber bodies may be changed or altered and their position may be adjustable.
            Spacers are allowed above or below the spring.

            Suspension bushings may be replaced with bushings of any materials as long as they fit
            in the original location. Offset bushings may be used. Bushing type may be changed to
            alternate types (e.g. spherical bearing). Pins or keys may be used to prevent the
            rotation of alternate bushings but may serve no other purpose than that of retaining
            the bushing in the desired position. Differential mount bushings are not considered to
            be suspension bushings and are not covered by this allowance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Differential mount bushings may be replaced but must attach in the factory location(s)
            without additional modification or changes. Differential position may not be changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Steering rack bushings may be replaced but must attach in the factory location(s)
            without additional modification or changes. Steering rack position may not be changed.
            Solid metal bushings are specifically prohibited. This does NOT allow shimming or
            otherwise relocating the steering rack.
          </li>
          <li>
            The following allowances apply to strut-type suspensions: Adjustable camber plates may
            be installed at the top of the strut and the original upper mounting holes may be
            slotted. The drilling of holes in order to perform the installation is permitted but the
            center clearance hole may not be modified. Any type of bearing or bushing may be used in
            the adjustable camber plate attachment to the strut. The installation may in-
            corporate an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block (bearing mount).
            Any ride height change resulting from installation of camber plates is allowed. Caster
            changes resulting from the use of camber plates are permitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Camber bolts may be installed providing these parts use the original, unmodified
            mounting points. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber bolts are permitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Camber kits, also known as camber compensators, may be installed. These kits consist of
            either adjustable length arms, arm mounts, or ball joints that provide a lateral
            adjustment to the effective length of a control arm. Alignment outside the factory
            specifications is allowed. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber kits are
            permitted. The following restrictions apply:
            <ul>
              <li>
                On double/unequal arm (e.g., wishbone, multi-link) suspensions, only the upper arms
                OR lower arms may be modified or replaced, but not both. Non-integral longitudinal
                arms that primarily control fore/aft wheel movement (e.g., trailing arm(s) or
                link(s) of a multi-link suspension) may not be replaced, changed, or modified.
              </li>
              <li>
                On arm-and-strut (MacPherson/Chapman) suspensions, the lower arms may be
                modified/replaced OR other methods of camber adjustment as allowed by Sections
                15.8.C, F, or G may be used, but NOT both.
              </li>
              <li>
                On swing or trailing arm suspensions, the main arms may not be modified or replaced
                but lateral locating links/arms may be modified or replaced.
              </li>
              <li>
                The replacement arms or mounts must attach to the original standard mounting
                points. All bushings must meet the requirements of Section 15.8.C. Intermediate
                mounting points (e.g., shock/spring mounts) may not be moved or relocated on the
                arm, except as incidental to the camber adjustment. The knuckle/bearing housing/
                spindle assembly cannot be modified or replaced.
              </li>
              <li>
                Changes in suspension geometry are not allowed except as incidental to the effective

                Methods of attachment and attachment points are unrestricted, but may serve no other
                purpose (e.g., chassis stiffening). This does not authorize removal of a welded-on
                part of a subframe or bodywork to accommodate the installation.

          <li>
            On strut-equipped cars, the strut's lower integral mounting bracket, for attachment to
            the upright or spindle, is unrestricted provided it attaches to the standard location.
            Any resulting change to the position of the strut centerline is allowed. Such brackets
            shall serve no other purpose. This does not allow for changes to the integral steering
            arm on cars that have the steering arm integrated with the strut body.

                alternate manufacturing techniques, or replacement with larger components.
              </li>
              <li>
                Components around or connected to the replaced component may not be relocated or
                modified unless permitted elsewhere in section 15.
              </li>
              <li>
                Heat treatment may be used to increase the durability of an original part and the
                resulting part will be considered a replaced component.
              </li>
              <li>
                Metal components may not be replaced with non-metal components. However a non-metal
                component may be replaced with a metal component so long as this does not violate
                other rules. For example the bushing metal content rule still applies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replaced components may not alter the suspension geometry unless otherwise permitted
                in section 15. Replacement hubs may relocate the wheel mating surface to widen the
                track width but may not relocate the wheel mating surface to narrow the track width.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replaced components may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and
                reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without improving
                performance. Components are not to be replaced to allow for increased power or
                larger tires but to replace common component failures. For example, hubs often
                become wear items that require frequent replacement to avoid failure. Hubs may be
                replaced with larger, stronger hubs to reduce the chance of failure and increase the
                life of the component.

            For cars originally equipped with transverse leaf springs, spring type may be changed to
            a coil spring. Spring perches may be added to shock absorbers for mounting coil springs
            in a "coilover" configuration.

            Fuel lines and pumps are unrestricted except as specified herein, as long as they do not
            pose a safety hazard. Fuel lines may be no larger than 1⁄2" (12.7 mm) i.d. (inside
            diameter) and may only connect to the original fuel tank or allowed fuel cell. They may
            be no longer than necessary for reasonable and safe installation, and may serve no other
            purpose. A single fuel feed line may be used. A single fuel return line may be used and
            a fitting for connecting it may be added at or near the top of the fuel tank. This does
            not authorize "cool-cans."

            Exhaust manifolds and muffler systems are free, except that they must be quiet and
            terminate behind the driver (Section 3.3.3.B.16). Exhaust heat shields may be removed.
            Rear and mid-engine cars without exhaust headers/manifold systems may use any exhaust
            syste" that meets the requirements of Section 3.5. This permits the removal of "heater
            boxes" in order to install headers on such cars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engine and transmission mounts may be replaced but must attach in the factory
            location(s) without additional modification or changes. Engine position may not be
            changed. Hydraulic shock type rear engine locators, or bobble struts, may be replaced by
            manufacturer's performance part or aftermarket replacement part. This part must retain
            factory dimensions and attachment points, including factory design. (Example: If
            factory locator/bobble strut is gas or hydraulic piston type, replacement part must be
            gas or hydraulic piston type.) If one or more non-OE engine or transmission mounts are
            used, Section 15.10.K does not apply and a torque suppression device may not be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            One bolt-on torque suppression device may be used. A torque suppres-
            sion device attaches from the engine to the body, frame, or subframe
            in one location and controls engine movement at that location along a
            single axis only. It may serve no other purpose.
            Examples of permitted devices:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A chain
              </li>

            Engine cooling radiators may be replaced with alternate parts subject to the following
            restrictions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Radiator dimensions (width, height, thickness, etc.) must be no smaller than the
                standard part.
              </li>
              <li>
                Radiator must mount to OE radiator mounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fluid capacity and dry weight of the radiator must be no less than that of the
                standard part. Installation of an alternate radiator may serve no other purpose
                (e.g., to allow a cold air intake passage).

            Full Prep: Any metal clutch assembly, metal flywheel, or metal torque converter that
            uses the standard attachment to the crankshaft may be used. Non-metallic friction
            surfaces (e.g., clutch discs) are permitted. Dowel pins may be added. Any hydraulic
            clutch line may be used. Replacement or substitution of the clutch master cylinder and
            clutch slave cylinder is permitted.

            Limited Prep: Any metal clutch assembly, metal flywheel, or metal torque converter that
            uses the standard attachment to the crankshaft may be used. Non-metallic friction
            surfaces (e.g., clutch disks) are permitted. Dowel pins may be added. Any hydraulic
            clutch line may be used. Replacement or substitution of the clutch slave cylinder is
            permitted. Clutch/Flywheel friction surface diameter must be the same as original
            equipment.

            Any mechanical shift linkage may be used
          </li>
          <li>
            Limited slip differentials are permitted. This permits locked differentials either by
            design, welding, or mechanical means. Differential cases, internal differential parts,
            and axle stubs may be machined as required for clearance and installation to the extent
            that material may only be removed, not added, and the exterior of the case may not be
            altered in any way. This machining may serve no other purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Full Prep: Cylinders may be rebored to no more than 0.0472" (1.20 mm) over standard bore
            and the appropriate standard oversize piston may be substituted. This overbore dimension
            is an absolute limit; no additional tolerance is permitted to accommodate wear. Cast or
            forged, non-standard pistons of the same dimensions and configuration as original
            equipment pistons may be used. Additionally the replacement pistons must be of the same
            weight or greater as the original equipment pistons. Replacement pistons must match OE
            piston configuration exactly including quench area. The allowance for the use of
            aftermarket forgings vs. OE castings does not permit alternate piston dome designs.
            This allowance does not permit alternative ring configurations.

            Full Prep: Intake and exhaust ports and manifold openings may be matched provided no
            change is made more than one inch from the port/ manifold interface. Material may be
            removed to facilitate port matching, but no material may be added.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any transmission and/or differential oil coolers may be used. Differential covers may
            be modified or substituted for cooling.

          <li>
            The engine cylinder head(s) may be milled only to that amount specified in the
            manufacturer's workshop manual. If no amount is specified then a maximum of 0.010"
            (0.254 mm) may be milled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Axle/halfshaft and driveshaft retention/location devices may be installed for safety
            reasons to control the motion of attached shafts upon the failure of a coupling or
            universal joint. They may serve no other purpose. This allowance does not include
            "C-clip eliminators."
          </li>
          <li>
            Any crankshaft damper or pulley may be used. SFI-rated dampers are recommended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any accessory pulleys and belts of the same type (e.g., V-belt, serpentine) as
            standard may be used. This allowance applies to accessory pulleys only (e.g.,
            alternator, water pump, power steering pump, and crankshaft drive pulleys). Alternate
            pulley materials may be used. Idler pulleys may be used for belt routing in place of
            items which the rules specifically allow to be removed such as smog pumps and air
            conditioning compressors. They may serve no other purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Camshafts and related parts must remain standard except that alternate cam drive
            pulleys or gears may be used to adjust cam timing if no variable cam and/or valve timing
            system exists as standard. Timing covers or valve covers may be altered for pulley
            clearance or access to adjustment. Type of cam drive (chain, belt, gear) must remain
            as standard. Alternate parts of the same general type (e.g., roller chain in place of
            "silent" chain) may be substituted. Mating parts (block, heads, covers, retainers, etc.)
            may not be altered except as mentioned above. Vehicles equipped with a variable cam
            and/or valve timing system as standard may use alternate computer calibration to adjust
            cam and/or valve timing but may not change or substitute cam drive components (hardware).

            Upper engine shields made of plastic material, the purpose of which is to hide
            mechanical components in the engine compartment, may be removed if they have a solely
            aesthetic and/or acoustic function.
          </li>

            Engine oil tanks for dry sump lubrication systems may be replaced with alternate parts
            subject to the following restrictions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Fluid capacity and dry weight of the oil tank must be no less than that of the
                standard part.
              </li>
              <li>
                Oil tank must mount in the OE location

            Drivetrain components may be replaced with aftermarket components in order to improve
            durability and reliability. Any replaced components are subject to the following
            restrictions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Replacement components may not be lighter than the original component.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replacement components must install without modification to the mating part.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replacement components may not differ from the original beyond improved strength,
                alternate manufacturing techniques, or replacement with larger components.
              </li>
              <li>
                Internal engine components such as pistons, connecting rods, or valve train
                components may not be replaced under this rule.
              </li>
              <li>
                Heat treatment may be used to increase the durability of an original part and the
                resulting part will be considered a replaced component.
              </li>
              <li>
                Metal components may not be replaced with non-metal components. However a non-metal
                component may be replaced with a metal component.
              </li>
              <li>
                Replaced components may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and
                reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without improving
                performance. Components are not to be replaced to allow for increased power or
                larger tires but to replace common component failures. For example, axle shafts or
                CV joints are often broken on launch. Under this rule these may be replaced with
                larger components or components made of stronger materials to avoid these breakages.
                Alternatively a vehicle may not replace a turbocharger with a larger or stronger
                part as this would increase the performance potential of the vehicle.
