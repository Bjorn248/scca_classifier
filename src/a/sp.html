          Authorized Modifications
        </h3>
        <ul class="sansserif list explanation">
          <li>
            All Allowable modifications permitted in Section 13, Street Category are allowed
          </li>
          <li>
            Street Prepared vehicles may only be modified in excess of Street Category rules in
            the following ways. Any modification not specifically authorized by the Street
            Category or Street Prepared rules is prohibited. No unauthorized modifications are
            permitted in order to accommodate authorized modifications (e.g., non-standard hood
            scoops or holes necessary for carburetor clearance). Structural modifications, such
            as the addition of members known as "jacking rails," are not permitted unless
            specifically authorized herein
          </li>
          <li>
            Full Prep: Equipment and/or specifications may be exchanged between different years
            and models of a vehicle if:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The item is standard on the year/model from which it was taken, and
              </li>
              <li>
                The years/models are listed on the same line of Appendix A, Street Prepared Classes
              </li>
            </ul>
            The updated/backdated part or the part to which it is to be attached may not be
            altered, modified, machined, welded, or otherwise changed to facilitate the
            updating/backdating allowance. Standard factory installation methods, locations, and
            configurations are allowed. The updating and/or backdating of engines,
            transmissions, transaxles, and/or unibodies must be done as a unit; component parts
            and specifications of these units may not be interchanged. Cars not listed in the
            Street Prepared Sections of Appendix A may not be updated/backdated until approved by
            the SEB and published in the official SCCA® publication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternate computer control modules may be used whenever an equivalent change to the
            conventional system is allowed. For example, alternate computer module control of
            ignition settings or fuel injection is allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air conditioning systems may be removed in whole or in part. This rule should not be
            interpreted to allow modification of the heater system.
          </li>
          <li>
            On all forms of suspension, camber/caster adjustment within factory specifications may
            be achieved by the use of shims or eccentric bushings. The intent of this allowance
            is to permit cars to be restored to within factory-allowed specification ranges, not
            to provide an additional method beyond those permitted in Section 15.8, Suspension,
            to obtain alignment settings beyond the factory specifications. Refer to Appendix F
            for past clarifications of these rules

          <ul class="sansserif list explanation">
            <li>
              Full Prep: Fenders and bumpers may be modified for tire clearance. This includes
              the portion of a hood which serves as a fender/wheel well, where applicable. This
              does not permit modifications to the chassis or bodywork inboard of the vertical
              plane of the hub/wheel mounting face (at rest, with front wheels straight ahead).
              Flares may be added although tires may extend beyond the bodywork. Replacement of
              complete hood, flared fenders, or quarter panels is prohibited. Plastic and rubber
              wheel well splash shields may be modified or removed for tire clearance and for
              installation of fender flares as allowed herein
            </li>
            <li>
              Hardware may be added to the steering system outside the passenger compartment to
              limit steering travel, provided it does not alter steering or suspension geometry
              within the limited range of motion and serves no other purpose
            </li>
            <li>
              Limited Prep: Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may be rolled to
              gain additional tire clearance. (The outer fender contour may not be changed.)
              Plastic and rubber wheel well splash shields may be modified for tire clearance and
              to accommodate a rolled inside fender lip. The modifications may serve no other
              purpose (e.g., air intake, brake ducts, etc.). No other changes to the standard
              fenders or wheel wells are permitted
            </li>
            <li>
              Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, rear wings, and/or spoilers may be removed
            </li>
            <li>
              Strut bars (per Section 12.18) are permitted with all types of suspensions,
              subject to the following constraints
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted, but only
                  with another two-point strut bar
                </li>
                <li>
                  A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or substituted;
                  substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point strut bar. The
                  connection to the chassis (i.e., firewall, bulkhead) must be in the standard
                  location
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension pickup point
                  locations on the chassis within two inches (2", 50.8 mm) in any direction of the
                  actual suspension attachment to the chassis
                </li>
                <li>
                  Except for standard parts, no connections to other components are permitted
                </li>
              </ul>
              Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts. Interior trim panels may be
              modified to allow installation of strut bars. Holes or slots may be no larger than
              necessary and may serve no other purpose. This does not permit any modifications to
              the frame or unibody beyond the allowed mounting holes
            </li>
            <li>
              Full Prep: Subframe mount bushings may be replaced, but must attach in the standard location(s)
              without additional modification or changes. Subframe position may not be
              changed
            </li>
            <li>
              Longitudinal (fore-aft) subframe connectors (SFCs) are permitted with the following
              restrictions
              <ul>
                <li>
                  They must only connect previously unconnected boxed frame rails on unibody
                  vehicles
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each SFC must attach at no more than three points on the unibody (e.g., front,
                  rear, and one point in between such as a seat mount brace or rocker box brace)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full Prep: SFCs must be bolted or welded, but welding must be to the OE subframe
                  stampings, not to the floor pan in between
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limited Prep: SFCs must be bolted
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cutting of OE subframes or floorpan stampings is permitted. Drilling is
                  permitted for mounting bolts only
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cross-car/lateral/triangulated connections directly between the driver's side
                  and passenger's side SFCs are permitted. Connections to OE components such as
                  tunnel braces or closure panels via bolts are allowed and count as the third
                  point of attachment. No alteration to the OE components is permitted
                </li>
                <li>
                  SFCs may not be used to attach other components (including but not limited to
                  torque arm front mounts or driveshaft loops) and may serve no other purpose
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The driver and front passenger seats may be replaced with the following
              restrictions: Seats must be securely mounted per Section 3.3.3.B.3. The seating
              surface must be fully upholstered. Any replacement seat must be a full back,
              bucket-type automobile seat incorporating a functional headrest. Kart seats,
              low-back dune buggy seats, and other similar types of seat are expressly
              prohibited. Cars may have no fewer than the standard number of seats. The seat
              tracks are considered part of the seat and may be substituted. Alternate seat tracks
              may serve no other purpose. The standard seat belts may be removed to facilitate the
              installation of alternate restraints complying with safety requirements. An
              alternate seat which replaces an airbag-equipped seat is not required to have an
              airbag
            </li>
            <li>
              Any steering wheel may be used. An alternate wheel which replaces an airbag-equipped
              wheel is not required to have an airbag. An alternate wheel is not required to have
              a horn button
            </li>
            <li>
              Airbags may be electrically disabled but not removed unless explicitly allowed
            </li>
            <li>
              Full Prep: Spoilers/splitters and cosmetic trim pieces are permitted. Side skirts
              may not be used. Spoilers/splitters must comply with the following:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A spoiler/splitter may be added to the front of the car below the bumper. It may
                  not extend rearward beyond the front most part of the front wheel well openings,
                  and may not block normal grille or other openings, or obstruct lights. Splitters
                  may not protrude beyond the bumper as viewed from above. Openings may not be
                  used for the purpose of ducting air to the radiator or oil cooler, but they may
                  allow air to flow through a permitted oil cooler provided no ducting is used.
                  The spoiler may not function as a wing. This allows a vertical air dam/spoiler
                  above a horizontal splitter, but splitter fences or longitudinal vertical
                  members that serve to trap air on top of the splitter by preventing it from
                  flowing around the sides of the car are not allowed
                </li>
                <li>
                  A spoiler may be added to the rear of the car provided it complies with either
                  of the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It is a production rear spoiler which is standard or optional equipment of
                      a US model of the vehicle or an exact replica in an alternate material
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It is a non-production rear spoiler which is mounted to the rearmost
                      portion of the rear hatch, deck, or trunk lid. The spoiler may extend no
                      more than 10" (254 mm) from the original bodywork in any direction.
                      Alternatively, in a hatchback, the spoiler may be mounted to the rear hatch
                      lid at or near the top of the hatch; in such a configuration the spoiler may
                      extend no more than 4" (101.6 mm) from the original bodywork in any
                      direction. The spoiler shall not protrude beyond the perimeter of the
                      original bodywork as viewed from above. The use of endplates is prohibited.
                      Angle of attack is free. The spoiler may not function as a wing
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limited Prep: Addition of spoilers, splitters, rear wings, bumper covers,
                  valances, side skirts, and non-functional scoops/vents is allowed provided that
                  either:

              Suspension and drivetrain mounting, including subframes, locations may be reinforced
              in order to improve durability and reliability. Any modifications are subject to the
              following restrictions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Material may only be added, not removed

                <li>
                  Mounting locations may not be moved in any direction
                </li>
                <li>
                  The method of attachment to other components may not be changed
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any added material may not inhibit any motion that would otherwise be uninhibited
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any modification must remain in the area of the attachment point to be
                  reinforced. This does not allow for braces or cross connection between otherwise
                  unconnected locations
                </li>
                <li>
                  Modifications may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and
                  reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without improving
                  performance. Modifications are not to be made to allow for increased power or
                  larger tires but to fix or prevent common failures of the vehicle structure or
                  subframes. This rule is intended to permit modifications to prevent common
                  failures such as suspension mounting location tear-outs or cracking shock

        Does your suspension meet the requirements defined below?
      </h2>
      <ul class="sansserif list explanation">
        <li>
          Shock absorber bump stops may be altered or removed
        </li>
        <li>
          On cars with lever-type shock absorbers, a tube-type shock absorber may be added. If the
          lever-type shock serves no other purpose, it must be removed. If the lever-type shock
          serves any other purpose, it must be retained
        </li>
        <li>
          Any shock absorbers may be used. Shock absorber mounting brackets which serve no other
          purpose may be altered, added or replaced provided that the attachment points on the
          body/frame/subframe/chassis/ suspension member are not altered. The installation may
          incorporate an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block (bearing mount).
          The system of attachment may be changed. The number of shock absorbers shall be the same
          as standard. No shock absorber may be capable of adjustment while the car is in motion
          unless fitted as original equipment. MacPherson strut equipped cars may substitute
          struts and/or may use any insert. This does not allow unauthorized changes in suspension
          geometry or changes in attachment points (e.g., affecting the position of the lower ball
          joint or spindle). It is intended to allow the strut length changes needed to
          accommodate permitted modifications which affect ride height and suspension travel.
        </li>
        <li>
          On strut suspensions using a non-standard lower control arm (as defined by Section
          15.8.H.2), an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block (bearing mount) as
          described in Section 15.5.C may be used provided it offers no camber/caster adjustment
          beyond standard
        </li>
        <li>
          Substitution, addition, or removal of any anti-roll bar(s) is permitted. Bushing
          material, method of attachment, and locating points are unrestricted. This does not
          authorize removal of a welded-on part of a subframe to accommodate the installation,
          or the cutting of holes to route the bar or links. Non-standard lateral members which
          connect between the brackets for the bar, including allowed strut bars per Section
          15.2.C, are permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          The bar may serve no other purpose which is not explicitly permitted elsewhere herein.
          Components such as anti-roll bars and strut housings which serve dual purposes by also
          functioning as suspension locators may not be modified or substituted in ways which
          change the suspension geometry or steering geometry, and may not be installed in
          positions (e.g., upside down) other than that of the original configuration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ride height may only be altered by suspension adjustments, the use of spacing blocks,
          leaf spring shackles, torsion bar levers, or change or modification of springs or coil
          spring perches. This does not allow the use of spacers which alter suspension geometry
          such as those between the hub carrier and lower suspension arm. Springs must be of the
          same type as the original (coil, leaf, torsion bar, etc.) and except as noted herein,
          must use the original spring attachment points. This permits multiple springs as long as
          they use the original mount locations. Coil spring perches originally attached to struts
          or shock absorber bodies may be changed or altered and their position may be adjustable.
          Spacers are allowed above or below the spring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Suspension bump stops may be altered or removed
        </li>
        <li>
          Suspension bushings may be replaced with bushings of any materials as long as they fit
          in the original location. Offset bushings may be used. Bushing type may be changed to
          alternate types (e.g. spherical bearing). Pins or keys may be used to prevent the
          rotation of alternate bushings but may serve no other purpose than that of retaining
          the bushing in the desired position. Differential mount bushings are not considered to
          be suspension bushings and are not covered by this allowance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Differential mount bushings may be replaced but must attach in the factory location(s)
          without additional modification or changes. Differential position may not be changed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Steering rack bushings may be replaced but must attach in the factory location(s)
          without additional modification or changes. Steering rack position may not be changed.
          Solid metal bushings are specifically prohibited. This does NOT allow shimming or
          otherwise relocating the steering rack.
        </li>
        <li>
          The following allowances apply to strut-type suspensions: Adjustable camber plates may
          be installed at the top of the strut and the original upper mounting holes may be
          slotted. The drilling of holes in order to perform the installation is permitted but the
          center clearance hole may not be modified. Any type of bearing or bushing may be used in
          the adjustable camber plate attachment to the strut. The installation may in-
          corporate an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block (bearing mount).
          Any ride height change resulting from installation of camber plates is allowed. Caster
          changes resulting from the use of camber plates are permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camber bolts may be installed providing these parts use the original, unmodified
          mounting points. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber bolts are permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camber kits, also known as camber compensators, may be installed. These kits consist of
          either adjustable length arms, arm mounts, or ball joints that provide a lateral
          adjustment to the effective length of a control arm. Alignment outside the factory
          specifications is allowed. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber kits are
          permitted. The following restrictions apply:
          <ul>
            <li>
              On double/unequal arm (e.g., wishbone, multi-link) suspensions, only the upper arms
              OR lower arms may be modified or replaced, but not both. Non-integral longitudinal
              arms that primarily control fore/aft wheel movement (e.g., trailing arm(s) or
              link(s) of a multi-link suspension) may not be replaced, changed, or modified.
            </li>
            <li>
              On arm-and-strut (MacPherson/Chapman) suspensions, the lower arms may be
              modified/replaced OR other methods of camber adjustment as allowed by Sections
              15.8.C, F, or G may be used, but NOT both.
            </li>
            <li>
              On swing or trailing arm suspensions, the main arms may not be modified or replaced
              but lateral locating links/arms may be modified or replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              The replacement arms or mounts must attach to the original standard mounting
              points. All bushings must meet the requirements of Section 15.8.C. Intermediate
              mounting points (e.g., shock/spring mounts) may not be moved or relocated on the
              arm, except as incidental to the camber adjustment. The knuckle/bearing housing/
              spindle assembly cannot be modified or replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changes in suspension geometry are not allowed except as incidental to the effective
              arm length change.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Solid axle suspension allowances:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Addition or replacement of suspension stabilizers (linkage connecting the axle
              housing or De Dion to the chassis, which controls lateral suspension location) is
              permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Traction bars or torque arms may be added or replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              A panhard rod may be added or replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              The upper arm(s) may be removed, replaced, or modified and the upper pickup points
              on the rear axle housing may be relocated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The lower arms may be replaced or modified and the lower pickup points on the rear
              axle housing may be relocated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Differential covers and attaching hardware may be replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              Methods of attachment and attachment points are unrestricted, but may serve no other
              purpose (e.g., chassis stiffening). This does not authorize removal of a welded-on
              part of a subframe or bodywork to accommodate the installation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          On strut-equipped cars, the strut's lower integral mounting bracket, for attachment to
          the upright or spindle, is unrestricted provided it attaches to the standard location.
          Any resulting change to the position of the strut centerline is allowed. Such brackets
          shall serve no other purpose. This does not allow for changes to the integral steering
          arm on cars that have the steering arm integrated with the strut body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in alignment parameters which result directly from the use of allowed components
          are permitted. For example, the dimensional changes resulting from the use of a
          cylindrical offset bushing which meets the restrictions of Section 15.8.C are allowed,
          including those resulting from a change in the pivoting action to:

          Suspension components may be replaced with aftermarket components in order to improve
          durability and reliability. Any replaced components are subject to the following
          restrictions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Replacement components may not be lighter than the original component.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replacement components must install without modification to the mating part.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replacement components may not differ from the original beyond improved strength,
              alternate manufacturing techniques, or replacement with larger components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Components around or connected to the replaced component may not be relocated or
              modified unless permitted elsewhere in section 15.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat treatment may be used to increase the durability of an original part and the
              resulting part will be considered a replaced component.
            </li>

              Metal components may not be replaced with non-metal components. However a non-metal
              component may be replaced with a metal component so long as this does not violate
              other rules. For example the bushing metal content rule still applies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replaced components may not alter the suspension geometry unless otherwise permitted
              in section 15. Replacement hubs may relocate the wheel mating surface to widen the
              track width but may not relocate the wheel mating surface to narrow the track width.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replaced components may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and
              reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without improving
              performance. Components are not to be replaced to allow for increased power or
              larger tires but to replace common component failures. For example, hubs often
              become wear items that require frequent replacement to avoid failure. Hubs may be
              replaced with larger, stronger hubs to reduce the chance of failure and increase the
              life of the component.

        <li>
          Air cleaner(s) may be changed or removed; velocity stacks may be added.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emission control devices may be modified or removed. This permits the oil filler cap to
          be modified or substituted but does not allow valve covers or cam covers to be altered
          to install a breather or for any other purpose.

        <li>
          Fuel lines and pumps are unrestricted except as specified herein, as long as they do not
          pose a safety hazard. Fuel lines may be no larger than 1⁄2" (12.7 mm) i.d. (inside
          diameter) and may only connect to the original fuel tank or allowed fuel cell. They may
          be no longer than necessary for reasonable and safe installation, and may serve no other
          purpose. A single fuel feed line may be used. A single fuel return line may be used and
          a fitting for connecting it may be added at or near the top of the fuel tank. This does
          not authorize "cool-cans."
        </li>
        <li>
          Exhaust manifolds and muffler systems are free, except that they must be quiet and
          terminate behind the driver (Section 3.3.3.B.16). Exhaust heat shields may be removed.
          Rear and mid-engine cars without exhaust headers/manifold systems may use any exhaust
          syste" that meets the requirements of Section 3.5. This permits the removal of "heater
          boxes" in order to install headers on such cars.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engine and transmission mounts may be replaced but must attach in the factory
          location(s) without additional modification or changes. Engine position may not be
          changed. Hydraulic shock type rear engine locators, or bobble struts, may be replaced by
          manufacturer's performance part or aftermarket replacement part. This part must retain
          factory dimensions and attachment points, including factory design. (Example: If
          factory locator/bobble strut is gas or hydraulic piston type, replacement part must be
          gas or hydraulic piston type.) If one or more non-OE engine or transmission mounts are
          used, Section 15.10.K does not apply and a torque suppression device may not be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          One bolt-on torque suppression device may be used. A torque suppres-
sion device attaches from the engine to the body, frame, or subframe
in one location and controls engine movement at that location along a
single axis only. It may serve no other purpose.
Examples of permitted devices:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A chain
            </li>

          Engine cooling radiators may be replaced with alternate parts subject to the following
          restrictions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Radiator dimensions (width, height, thickness, etc.) must be no smaller than the
              standard part.
            </li>
            <li>
              Radiator must mount to OE radiator mounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fluid capacity and dry weight of the radiator must be no less than that of the
              standard part. Installation of an alternate radiator may serve no other purpose
              (e.g., to allow a cold air intake passage).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The engine fan and fan shroud (unless it serves another purpose, e.g., as an
          alternator/generator mount) may be removed, modified or replaced. Electrically driven
          fans are allowed. Flex fans are not allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          On two-cycle engines, the ports must be of standard heights, size and configuration;
          crankcase volume and reed plates must not be altered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full Prep: Any metal clutch assembly, metal flywheel, or metal torque converter that
          uses the standard attachment to the crankshaft may be used. Non-metallic friction
          surfaces (e.g., clutch discs) are permitted. Dowel pins may be added. Any hydraulic
          clutch line may be used. Replacement or substitution of the clutch master cylinder and
          clutch slave cylinder is permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limited Prep: Any metal clutch assembly, metal flywheel, or metal torque converter that
          uses the standard attachment to the crankshaft may be used. Non-metallic friction
          surfaces (e.g., clutch disks) are permitted. Dowel pins may be added. Any hydraulic
          clutch line may be used. Replacement or substitution of the clutch slave cylinder is
          permitted. Clutch/Flywheel friction surface diameter must be the same as original
          equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any mechanical shift linkage may be used
        </li>
        <li>
          Limited slip differentials are permitted. This permits locked differentials either by
          design, welding, or mechanical means. Differential cases, internal differential parts,
          and axle stubs may be machined as required for clearance and installation to the extent
          that material may only be removed, not added, and the exterior of the case may not be
          altered in any way. This machining may serve no other purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full Prep: Cylinders may be rebored to no more than 0.0472" (1.20 mm) over standard bore
          and the appropriate standard oversize piston may be substituted. This overbore dimension
          is an absolute limit; no additional tolerance is permitted to accommodate wear. Cast or
          forged, non-standard pistons of the same dimensions and configuration as original
          equipment pistons may be used. Additionally the replacement pistons must be of the same
          weight or greater as the original equipment pistons. Replacement pistons must match OE
          piston configuration exactly including quench area. The allowance for the use of
          aftermarket forgings vs. OE castings does not permit alternate piston dome designs.
          This allowance does not permit alternative ring configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full Prep: Rotating and reciprocating parts may be balanced but not lightened.
        </li>
        <li>
          Full Prep: Intake and exhaust ports and manifold openings may be matched provided no
          change is made more than one inch from the port/ manifold interface. Material may be
          removed to facilitate port matching, but no material may be added.

          Any transmission and/or differential oil coolers may be used. Differential covers may
          be modified or substituted for cooling.
        </li>
        <li>
          The engine cylinder head(s) may be milled only to that amount specified in the
          manufacturer's workshop manual. If no amount is specified then a maximum of 0.010"
          (0.254 mm) may be milled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Axle/halfshaft and driveshaft retention/location devices may be installed for safety
          reasons to control the motion of attached shafts upon the failure of a coupling or
          universal joint. They may serve no other purpose. This allowance does not include
          "C-clip eliminators."
        </li>
        <li>
          Any crankshaft damper or pulley may be used. SFI-rated dampers are recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any accessory pulleys and belts of the same type (e.g., V-belt, serpentine) as
          standard may be used. This allowance applies to accessory pulleys only (e.g.,
          alternator, water pump, power steering pump, and crankshaft drive pulleys). Alternate
          pulley materials may be used. Idler pulleys may be used for belt routing in place of
          items which the rules specifically allow to be removed such as smog pumps and air
          conditioning compressors. They may serve no other purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camshafts and related parts must remain standard except that alternate cam drive
          pulleys or gears may be used to adjust cam timing if no variable cam and/or valve timing
          system exists as standard. Timing covers or valve covers may be altered for pulley
          clearance or access to adjustment. Type of cam drive (chain, belt, gear) must remain
          as standard. Alternate parts of the same general type (e.g., roller chain in place of
          "silent" chain) may be substituted. Mating parts (block, heads, covers, retainers, etc.)
          may not be altered except as mentioned above. Vehicles equipped with a variable cam
          and/or valve timing system as standard may use alternate computer calibration to adjust
          cam and/or valve timing but may not change or substitute cam drive components (hardware).
        </li>
        <li>
          Upper engine shields made of plastic material, the purpose of which is to hide
          mechanical components in the engine compartment, may be removed if they have a solely
          aesthetic and/or acoustic function.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cruise control systems may be removed in whole or part
        </li>
        <li>
          Engine oil tanks for dry sump lubrication systems may be replaced with alternate parts
          subject to the following restrictions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fluid capacity and dry weight of the oil tank must be no less than that of the
              standard part.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oil tank must mount in the OE location
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Drivetrain components may be replaced with aftermarket components in order to improve
          durability and reliability. Any replaced components are subject to the following
          restrictions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Replacement components may not be lighter than the original component.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replacement components must install without modification to the mating part.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replacement components may not differ from the original beyond improved strength,
              alternate manufacturing techniques, or replacement with larger components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Internal engine components such as pistons, connecting rods, or valve train
              components may not be replaced under this rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat treatment may be used to increase the durability of an original part and the
              resulting part will be considered a replaced component.
            </li>
            <li>
              Metal components may not be replaced with non-metal components. However a non-metal
              component may be replaced with a metal component.
            </li>
            <li>
              Replaced components may serve no purpose other than to increase durability and
              reliability. This allowance is intended to improve durability without improving
              performance. Components are not to be replaced to allow for increased power or
              larger tires but to replace common component failures. For example, axle shafts or
              CV joints are often broken on launch. Under this rule these may be replaced with
              larger components or components made of stronger materials to avoid these breakages.
              Alternatively a vehicle may not replace a turbocharger with a larger or stronger
              part as this would increase the performance potential of the vehicle.

          Cars with combustion chamber oil injection systems (such as those in rotary engines) may
          supplement the standard engine lubrication system with additional oil supplied through
          the standard fuel delivery system.
