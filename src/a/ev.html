        <p>
        The purpose of EVX is to provide an alternative class specifically targeted towards
        production electric powered vehicles. This ruleset draws from Street and Street Touring
        with the intention of choosing commonsense allowances to balance streetability and autocross
        preparation. Example: In many cases cars come from the factory with narrow wheels to
        improve real-world range. Wider wheels/tires will diminish range slightly, but still work
        well for street use while improving autocross performance.

        <h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Accessories, gauges, indicators, lights and other appearance, comfort
              and convenience modifications which have no effect on performance
              and/or handling and do not materially reduce the weight of the car are
              permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data acquisition systems (including video cameras) and the accompanying sensors
              are allowed but may serve no other purpose during a run other than real-time
              display and data recording.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spare tires, tools, and jacks may be removed. Any fastening hardware
              and/or other pieces that can no longer be firmly secured in the absence
              of the spare tire may be removed if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Roll Bars and Roll Cages
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Roll bars may be added. Roll bars may be welded in. Standard rollover hoops and
                  covers may be removed if the resulting installation meets Appendix C.A,
                  Basic Design Considerations. The total weight of components added must not be
                  less than that of components removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Roll cages may be added. It is strongly recommended that roll cages be constructed
                  according to the Club Racing GCR, though they must be bolted (not welded) into
                  the automobile and be contained within the driver/passenger compartment. A roll
                  cage has more than four attachment points to the body or frame or has bracing
                  both fore and aft of the main hoop.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Driver restraints as outlined in Section 3.3.1 are allowed. Seats may not
              be cut to allow for the installation of alternate seat belts or harnesses.
              Passive restraint systems may disabled but may not be removed. Removable seat
              headrests may be repositioned using the original mounting hardware only if the OE
              components permit it with no modifications. This includes removing a headrest and
              reinstalling it backwards. A horizontal "harness bar" may be used as part of the
              installation hardware for allowed driver restraints provided it has no more than 2
              attachment points to the chassis and is bolted at those locations. A C-type
              harness bar may also be used. It may have 4 bolted attachment points to
              the chassis (2 primary and 2 supporting connections to resist rotation).
              Truss-type harness bars with more than two (2) attachment points are
              not allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cars may add one rear trailer hitch. The resulting weight addition is allowed.
              The hitch may serve no other purpose. Factory tie downs and cosmetic pieces
              (e.g. diffusers) may be modified or removed to facilitate hitch installation.
              Complete or partial removal of the hitch is allowed for competition, provided it
              does not result in a reduction in weight compared to the unmodified standard
              configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tow bar brackets may be installed but may serve no other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any item that cannot be held permanently in place by factory-installed fasteners
              may be removed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, bolt-on front valance lips/spoilers, and
              fog lights (except those integral to a headlight or turn signal) may be removed.
              Rear wings may be removed so long as the vehicle retains any federally-mandated third brake light.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may be rolled to gain additional
              tire clearance. (The outer fender contour may not be changed.) Plastic and rubber
              wheel well splash shields may be modified for tire clearance and to accommodate a
              rolled inside fender lip. The modifications may serve no other purpose
              (e.g., air intake, brake ducts, etc). No other changes to the standard fenders or wheel
              wells are permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strut bars are permitted with all types of suspension, subject to the
              following constraints:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted, but only
                  with another 2-point strut bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or substituted;
                  substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point strut
                  bar. The connection to the chassis (e.g., firewall, bulkhead) must be in
                  the standard location.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension pickup point
                  locations on the chassis within 2" (50.8mm) in any direction of the actual
                  suspension attachment to the chassis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Except for standard parts, no connections to other components are permitted.
                  Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts. Only "bolt-on" attachment is
                  permitted. Interior trim panels may be modified to allow installation of strut
                  bars. Holes or slots may be no larger thannecessary and may serve no other purpose.
                  This does not permit any modifications to the frame or unibody beyond the allowed mounting
                  holes.

            The diameter for replacement rotors is measured at the minimum outside dimension.
            Aluminum rotor hats are allowed. Cars originally equipped with solid (non-vented)
            rotors may utilize vented rotors. Cross-drilled and/or slotted brake rotors may be fitted

            special bolts, removal of material to enlarge mounting holes, and similar methods are
            allowed and the resulting alignment settings are permitted even if outside the normal
            specification or range of specifications recommended by the manufacturer. If
            enlarging mounting holes is specifically authorized but no material removal limits
            are specified, material removal is restricted to the amount necessary to achieve the
            maximum factory alignment specifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Camber bolts may be installed providing these parts use the original, unmodified
            mounting points. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber bolts are permitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Camber kits (also known as camber compensators) may be installed. These kits consist
            of either adjustable length arms or arm mounts (including ball joints) that provide a
            lateral adjustment to the effective length of a control arm. Alignment outside the
            factory specifications is allowed. The following restrictions apply:
            <ul>
              <li>
                On double/unequal arm (e.g., wishbone, multi-link) suspensions, only the upper
                arms OR lower arms may be modified or replaced, but not both. Non-integral
                longitudinal arms that primarily control fore/aft wheel movement (e.g., trailing
                arm(s) or link(s) of a multi-link suspension) may not be replaced, changed, or
                modified.
              </li>
              <li>
                On arm-and-strut (MacPherson/Chapman) suspensions, the lower arms may be
                modified/replaced OR other methods of camber adjustment allowed by the EV rules
                can be utilized, but NOT both.
              </li>
              <li>
                The replacement arms or mounts must attach to the original standard mounting
                points. Intermediate mounting points (e.g., shock/spring mounts) may not be moved
                or relocated on the arm, except as incidental to the camber adjustment. The
                knuckle/bearing housing/spindle assembly cannot be modified or replaced.
              </li>
              <li>
                Changes in suspension geometry are not allowed except as incidental to the
                effective arm length change.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes in alignment parameters that result directly from the use of the allowed
            components are permitted.
          </li>
