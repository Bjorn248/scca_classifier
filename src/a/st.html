        <h3>
          Category Objective
        </h3>
        <p>
          Street Touring allowances and modifications build upon existing Street category allowances.
          Competitors in this class are looking to add performance to a select group of vehicles based
          on performance potential.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Category Values
        </h3>
        <p>
          Vehicle modifications should not prevent daily use on public roads.
          "Daily use" is subjective criterion; competitors will interpret this differently.
          "Street legal" is a category goal. Some states may require more stringent requirements.
          It is not the intention of "street legality" to be an absolute. It is intended for the
          majority of the membership. Drivetrain configuration variances are balanced through
          limited slip differential and wheel/tire allowances.

          14.2 BODYWORK</br></br>A. Pedal cover kits and other interior cosmetic accessories may be added.
&#34;Dress-up&#34; items such as chrome dipsticks and non-standard filler caps
are permitted, provided they serve no other purpose.</br></br>B. The driver and front passenger seats may be replaced with the following restrictions. The seating surface must be fully upholstered. The top
of the seat, or an attached headrest, may not be below the center of
the driver’s head. The seat, including mounting hardware, must weigh
at least 25 pounds and must be attached using the OE body mounting
holes/studs. Additional mounting points may be added.</br></br>C. Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, bolt-on front valance lips/
spoilers, and fog lights (except those integral to a headlight or turn signal) may be removed. Rear wings may be removed so long as the vehicle
retains a third brake light.</br></br>D. Any steering wheel may be used. An alternate steering wheel assembly,
including all mounting hardware which replaces an airbag-equipped
wheel, is not required to have an airbag but must weigh at least as much
as the standard assembly. An alternate steering wheel is not required to
have a horn button.</br></br>E. Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may be rolled to
gain additional tire clearance. (The outer fender contour may not be
changed.) Plastic and rubber wheel well splash shields may be modified for tire clearance and to accommodate a rolled inside fender lip.
The modifications may serve no other purpose (e.g., air intake, etc). No
other changes to the standard fenders or wheel wells are permitted.

</br></br>F. Addition or substitution of spoilers, splitters, rear wings, bumper covers, valances, side skirts, and non-functional scoops/vents is allowed
provided that either:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. It is a standard or optional production part which could be ordered
on the US model vehicle as part of the base package or part of a higher trim package. The trim package must be classed in any of the current Street Touring classes.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. It is listed in the vehicle manufacturer’s US accessory catalog for that
vehicle for normal highway use. This does not allow for parts sold
through a manufacturer’s performance catalog (e.g., Ford Racing,
HPD, Mazdaspeed, Mopar Performance, Mugen, NISMO, SPT, TRD,
etc).
Parts must be installed as directed by the manufacturer. Exact replicas,
including weight, from alternate sources are also permitted.</div></br></br>G. Strut bars per Section 12 are permitted with all types of suspension,
subject to the following constraints:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted,
but only with another 2-point strut bar.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or substituted; substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point
strut bar. The connection to the chassis (e.g., firewall, bulkhead)
must be in the standard location.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension
pickup point locations on the chassis within 2&#34; (50.8mm) in any direction of the actual suspension attachment to the chassis.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Except for standard parts, no connections to other components are
permitted.
Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts. Only &#34;bolt-on&#34; attachment is permitted. Interior trim panels may be modified to allow
installation of strut bars. Holes or slots may be no larger than necessary
and may serve no other purpose. This does not permit any modifications to the frame or unibody beyond the allowed mounting holes.</div></br></br>H. Longitudinal (fore-aft) subframe connectors (&#34;SFCs&#34;) are permitted
with the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. They must only connect previously unconnected boxed frame rails
on unibody vehicles.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Each SFC must attach at no more than 3 points on the unibody (e.g.,
front, rear, and one point in between such as a seat mount brace or
rocker box brace).</div><div class="indent"></br>3. SFCs must be bolted in place and not welded.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. No cutting of OE subframes or floorpan stampings is permitted.
Drilling is permitted for mounting bolts only.


</div><div class="indent"></br>5. No cross-car/lateral/triangulated connections directly between the
driver’s side and passenger’s side SFCs are permitted. Connections
to OE components such as tunnel braces or closure panels via bolts
are allowed and count as the third point of attachment. No alteration
to the OE components is permitted.</div></br>6. SFCs may not be used to attach other components (including but
not limited to torque arm front mounts or driveshaft loops) and may
serve no other purpose.

Cars originally equipped with solid (non-vented) rotors may utilize
vented rotors. Cross-drilled and/or slotted brake rotors may be fitted
provided all such voids are within the disc area and comprise no more
than 10% of that area.</br></br>B. Brake lines may be substituted with alternate DOT-approved flexible
brake lines.</br></br>C. Air ducts may be fitted to the brakes provided the air directed to the
brake rotor originates forward of the wheel well. Modifications to fender liners, undertrays, and splash guards for routing of ducts is permitted. No new holes may be made in the bumper cover. Backing plates
and dust shields may be substituted, modified, or removed. Deflectors
that mount to components within the wheel well and serve to direct air
towards the rotors are permitted. Modifications for brake ducting may
serve no other purpose.</br></br>D. Original equipment ABS braking systems may be electrically disabled
but may not be removed or altered in any other way.</br></br>E. Disc brake calipers and mounting brackets may be replaced provided
they bolt to the standard locations and the number of pistons is equal
to or greater than standard. A functioning emergency brake of the same
type, operation, and actuation as OE must be present.</br></br>F. Drum brakes may be replaced with disc brakes of a diameter equal to
or greater than the inside diameter of the standard drum. Such conversions must be bolted, not welded, to the axle/trailing arm/upright and
must include an integral, redundant emergency brake. The emergency
brake must utilize the OE actuation method (e.g. pedal vs handle) and
components. The emergency brake must be integral to the new caliper, a drum brake style assembly within the new rotor, or a separate
emergency brake caliper must be used. Changes to backing plates/dust
shields/brake lines/emergency brake cables to accommodate these
changes are permitted but may serve no other purpose.</br></br>G. A single brake master cylinder brace may be added provided it is bolton and serves no other purpose.

coil spring. Spring perches may be added to shock absorbers for mounting coil springs in a &#34;coilover&#34; configuration.</br></br>B. Suspension bushings may be replaced with bushings of any materials as long as they fit in the original location. Offset bushings may be
used. This does not authorize a change in type of bushing (e.g., ball
and socket replacing a cylindrical bushing) or use of a bushing with an
angled hole whose direction differs from that of the original bushing.
If the standard bushing accommodated multi-axis motion via compliance of the component material(s), the replacement bushing may not
be changed to accommodate such motion via a change in bushing type,
for example to a spherical bearing or similar component involving internal moving parts. Pins or keys may be used to prevent the rotation of
alternate bushings but may serve no other purpose than that of retaining the bushing in the desired position.</br></br>C. The following allowances apply to strut-type suspensions. Adjustable
camber plates may be installed at the top of the strut and the original
upper mounting holes may be slotted. The drilling of holes in order to
perform the installation is permitted. The center clearance hole may
not be modified. Any type of bearing or bushing may be used in the adjustable camber plate attachment to the strut. The installation may incorporate an alternate upper spring perch/seat and/or mounting block
(bearing mount). Any ride height change resulting from installation of
camber plates is allowed. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber plates are permitted.
</br></br>D. Differential mount bushings may be replaced but must attach in the
standard location(s) without additional modification or changes. Differential position may not be changed. Solid metal bushings are specifically prohibited.</br></br>E. Steering rack bushings may be replaced but must attach in the factory
location(s) without additional modification or changes. Steering rack
position may not be changed. The amount of metal in a replacement
bushing may not be increased relative to the amount of metal found in
a standard bushing for the particular application. Solid metal bushings
are specifically prohibited. This does NOT allow shimming or otherwise
relocating the steering rack.</br></br>F. Camber bolts may be installed providing these parts use the original,
unmodified mounting points and meet the restrictions specified in Section 14.5.B. Caster changes resulting from the use of camber bolts are
permitted.</br></br>G. Solid axle rear wheel drive (RWD) suspension allowances:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Addition or replacement of suspension stabilizers (linkage connecting the axle housing or DeDion to the chassis, which controls lateral
suspension location) is permitted.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Traction bars or torque arms may be added or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. A Panhard rod may be added or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. The upper arm(s) may be removed, replaced, or modified and the
upper pickup points on the rear axle housing may be relocated.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. The lower arms may be replaced or modified and the lower pickup
points on the rear axle housing may be relocated.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Differential covers and attaching hardware may be replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>7. Methods of attachment and attachment points are unrestricted but
may serve no other purpose (e.g., chassis stiffening). This does not
authorize removal of a welded on part of a subframe to accommodate
the installation.</div></br></br>H. Camber kits (also known as camber compensators) may be installed.
These kits consist of either adjustable length arms or arm mounts (including ball joints) that provide a lateral adjustment to the effective
length of a control arm. Alignment outside the factory specifications is
allowed. The following restrictions apply:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. On double/unequal arm (e.g., wishbone, a-arm) suspensions, only
the upper arms OR lower arms may be modified or replaced, but not
both.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. On arm-and-strut (MacPherson/Chapman) suspensions, the lower
arms may be modified/replaced OR other methods of camber adjustment as allowed by Sections 14.8.B, C, or F may be used, but NOT
both.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. On swing or trailing arm suspensions, the main arms may not be



modified or replaced, but lateral locating links/arms may be modified or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Front wheel drive (FWD) cars with rear beam axles may use shims
between the rear axle and hubs.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. The replacement arms or mounts must attach to the original standard mounting points. All bushings must meet the requirements of
Section 14.8.B. Intermediate mounting points (e.g., shock/spring
mounts) may not be moved or relocated on the arm, except as incidental to the camber adjustment. The knuckle/bearing housing/
spindle assembly cannot be modified or replaced.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Changes in suspension geometry are not allowed except as incidental
to the effective arm length change.</div><div class="indent"></br>7. On multi-link suspensions only one lateral link or arm per corner
may be modified or replaced. Non-integral longitudinal arms that
primarily control fore/aft wheel movement (e.g., trailing arm(s) or
link(s)) may not be replaced, changed, or modified.&#34;
Note:</br> Many modern suspension designs known by other names, actually function as double A-arm designs. These include the rear suspensions on 1988-on Honda Civic/Integra, Chrysler/Plymouth/Dodge
Neon, BMW E36, and most &#34;multi-link&#34; and are covered by Section
14.8.H.1.</div></br></br>I. On strut-equipped cars, the strut’s lower integral mounting bracket, for
attachment to the upright or spindle, is unrestricted provided it attaches to the standard location. Any resulting change to the position of the
strut centerline is allowed. Such brackets shall serve no other purpose.
This does not allow for changes to the integral steering arm on cars that
have the steering arm integrated with the strut body.</br></br>J. Changes in alignment parameters that result directly from the use of
the allowed components are permitted. For example, the dimensional
changes resulting from the use of a cylindrical offset bushing that meets
the restrictions of Section 14.8.B are allowed, including those resulting
from a change in the pivoting action to:</br>
- About the mounting bolt, or
- About the bushing itself.</br></br>K. Subframe mount bushings may be replaced, but must attach in the
standard location(s) without additional modification or changes. Subframe position may not be changed. Solid metal bushings are specifically prohibited.

          14.10 ENGINE AND DRIVETRAIN</br></br>A. Oil pans, oil pickups, and differential covers may be modified or substituted. Addition or modification of windage trays or crankshaft scrapers is not allowed. Engine oil, transmission fluid, differential fluid, and
power steering fluid coolers may be added or substituted (including oil
to coolant heat exchangers) but may not serve any additional purpose.
Modifications necessary to route fluids to an appropriate heat exchanger (modification of oil and coolant lines, addition of oil cooler sandwich
adapters, addition of fluid pumps, etc.) is allowed provided they serve
no other purpose.</br></br>B. Original equipment traction and stability control systems may be electrically disabled, but not removed or altered in any other way.</br></br>C. The air intake system up to, but not including, the engine inlet may be
modified or replaced. The engine inlet is the throttle body, carburetor,
compressor inlet, or intake manifold, whichever comes first. The existing structure of the car may not be modified for the passage of ducting from the air cleaner to the engine inlet. Holes may be drilled for
mounting. PCV valves and or engine management components in the
air intake system mass airflow sensors, may not be removed, modified,
or replaced, and must retain their original function along the flow path.
		1. SST, STU and STH only:</br> As utilized only on engines originally
equipped with forced induction, induction charge heat exchangers (also
known as &#34;intercoolers&#34; or &#34;charge air coolers&#34; [CACs]) are unrestricted
in size and shape. Air-to-air CACs and radiators for air-to-liquid CACs
must be cooled only by the atmosphere except for standard parts. Body
panels, fascias, or structural members may not be cut or altered to facilitate CAC installation. Removal of vehicle components to facilitate
installation is not allowed. Holes may be drilled for mounting.
		 2. SST, STU and STH only:</br> Charge pipes may be modified or replaced.
Replacement charge pipes may delete or block off factory pipes designed
to enhance intake sounds (&#34;noisemakers&#34;). Modification or deletion of
vehicle components (e.g. plastic shrouds, wheel well liners) to permit
routing of alternate charge pipes is not allowed.



		 3. Compressor Bypass Valves (CBVs), blow-off valves, and pop-off
valves may be replaced or modified.
		 4. Boost regulation systems, either electronic or mechanical, and electronic fuel cuts referencing boost pressure may be modified, replaced,
or removed. This does not allow for changes to the turbocharger or wastegate (including wastegate spring).</br></br>D. Exhaust manifolds, headers, downpipes, and associated EGR tubes
may be replaced with alternate units. Exhaust exit may be relocated
provided it meets Section 3.3.3.B.16. Relocation of the oxygen sensor
on the header is permitted, including lengthening or shortening oxygen
sensor wiring. Exhaust heat shields which cover only, and attach solely
to, these parts may also be replaced, removed, or modified. All other exhaust heat shields may be modified the minimum amount necessary to
accommodate allowed alternate exhaust components. Mounting brackets/hardware which serve no other purpose are considered part of the
exhaust components.</br></br>E. Any catalytic converters are allowed with the following constraints.
Multiple catalytic converters may be replaced by a single unit. The
inlet(s) of the replacement converter(s) must be located between the
cylinder head and a point 6&#34; (152.4 mm) further along the exhaust flow
path from the original exit of the final OE converter.
For vehicles that were delivered with multiple exhaust configurations
(i.e. California vs 49-state legal cars) any of the OE exhaust configurations may be used for the purpose of determining the location of the
aftermarket catalytic converter.
The extents of an OE converter are defined by the expansion chamber
in which the catalyst is contained, regardless of placement within larger
exhaust sections. Replacement converters must have a minimum catalyst density of 100 cells per inch and minimum substrate length of 3&#34;
(76.2 mm).</br></br>F. The engine management system parameters and operation of internal
combustion engines may be modified only via the methods listed below. Any OE OBD2 or newer communications port functionally must
remain. The Check Engine Light (CEL) or Malfunction Indicator Light
(MIL) may be disabled via software. Only sensors equipped from the
manufacturer may be used for engine management.<div class="indent"></br>1. For all model years, the following allowances apply:</br>
a. The standard PCM/ECU may be re-programmed without restriction.
b. Fuel pressure regulator(s) may be replaced in lieu of electronic
hardware or software alterations. It is not permitted to mechanically alter the fuel pressure regulation AND make other hardware
or software changes to engine operation.

c. Ignition timing may be set at any point on factory-adjustable distributor ignition systems.
d. Electronic components may be installed in-line between the engine sensors and PCM/ECU. These components may only alter
the signal from the sensor in order to affect the PCM/ECU operation. Example:</br> Fuel controllers that modify the signal from an
airflow sensor.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. For 2005 and older model year vehicles:</br>
a. A supplementary (&#34;piggyback&#34;) ECU is permitted. It must be plugcompatible with the standard PCM/ECU (no splices) and must
connect only between the standard PCM/ECU and its wiring harness.
b. VTEC controllers and other devices may be used which alter the
timing of manufacturer electronic variable-valve systems.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. 1995 and older vehicles may implement a replacement &#34;stand-alone&#34;
PCM/ECU.</div></br></br>G. Any mechanical shift linkage may be used.</br></br>H. Any accessory pulleys and belts of the same type (e.g., V-belt, serpentine) as standard may be used. This allowance applies to accessory
pulleys only (e.g., alternator, water pump, power steering pump, and
crankshaft drive pulleys). It does not allow replacement, modification,
or substitution of pulleys, cogs, gears, or belts which are part of cam,
layshaft, or ignition drive or timing systems, etc. Any crankshaft damper or pulley may be used. SFI-rated dampers are recommended. Supercharged cars may not change the effective diameter of any pulley which
drives the supercharger.</br></br>I. Upper engine shields made of plastic material, the purpose of which
is to hide mechanical components in the engine compartment, may be
removed if they have a solely aesthetic and/or acoustic function.</br></br>J. Any engine or transmission mount is allowed provided it attaches only
to the original mounting points, does not relocate the engine/transmission (other than incidental to changes in compliance material), and
weighs no less than the OE mount. All components between the engine/
transmission and the mounting structure are considered to be part of
the mount assembly.</br></br>K. Limited Slip Differentials<div class="indent"></br>1. STS class:</br> No limited slip differentials are permitted except for factory standard viscous coupler-type units.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. SST, STU, STR, and STX classes:</br> 2WD vehicles may use any mechanical LSD unit. AWD vehicles may substitute one differential
(front, rear, or center) with an aftermarket mechanical LSD.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. STH:</br> 2WD vehicles may use any mechanical LSD unit.
</div></br></br>L. Engine cooling radiators may be replaced with alternate parts subject to
the following restrictions:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. Radiator core dimensions (width, height, thickness) cannot be smaller than the standard part.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Radiator must mount to OE radiator mounts.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Fluid capacity and dry weight of the radiator must be no less than
that of the standard part. Installation of an alternate radiator may
serve no other purpose (e.g., to allow a cold air intake passage).</div><div class="indent"></br>4. A replacement radiator may contain an integrated oil cooler provided
the portion of the radiator that is utilized for coolant conforms to the
remainder of 14.10.L.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Installation of an alternate radiator may serve no other purpose (e.g.
to allow a cold air intake passage).</div></br></br>M.Cars with combustion chamber oil injection systems (such as those in
rotary engines) may supplement the standard engine lubrication with
additional oil supplied through the standard fuel delivery system and/
or an oil-metering-pump (OMP) adaptor plate. An oil storage tank may
be added to provide oil to the OMP. Holes may be drilled for mounting.</br></br>N. A single clutch master cylinder brace may be added provided it is bolton and serves no other purpose.</br></br>O. The clutch disk and pressure plate of traditional, pedal operated manual transmissions may be modified or replaced.</br></br>P. The Transmission Control Unit (TCU) may be re-programmed. This
allowance only applies to modification of transmission behaviors and
does not extend to re-programming any other components.</br></br>Q. Except for AWD cars in STH, electronic differentials may be re-programmed. This allowance only applies to changing differential behaviors and does not extend to re-programming any other components.
