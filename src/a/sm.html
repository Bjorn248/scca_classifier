          Category Objective
        </h3>
        <p>
        Street Modified allows competitors to modify vehicles using advanced fabrication and
        tuning with specific limitations. Street Modified provides the allowances of the
        lower-prep categories with the addition of major modifications to the drivetrain,
        suspension, and body as well as sophisticated aerodynamic components
        </p>
        <p>
        The purpose of this category is to serve as a membership recruitment and retention tool
        by providing a natural competition outlet for auto enthusiasts using streetable sport
        sedans equipped with drivetrain and suspension modifications that are beyond those
        allowed in the Street Prepared category. Cars identical to the US-market counterpart
        except for comfort and convenience modifications as allowed per Section 13.2.A.
        See Sections 3.8 and 8.3.1 for documentation requirements

                  Wings may be added, removed, or modified. Non-OE wings may only be attached to
                  the rear deck/hatch area behind the centerline of the rear axle. The total
                  combined surface area of all wings shall not exceed 8 sq. ft. (0.7432 m 2 ) as
                  calculated per the Wing Area 2021 SCCA® National Solo® Rules— 12116. Street
                  Modified Computation in Section 12. The number of wing elements is limited to
                  two (2).

                <li>
                  Wings, and any component thereof, may not extend beyond the vehicle width, as
                  defined by the outermost portion of the vehicle doors, less mirrors, door
                  handles, rub strips, and trim. In addition, no portion of the wing or its
                  components may be more than 6.0" forward of the rear axle, more than 0.0" beyond
                  the rear most portion of the bodywork, or more than 6.0" above the roofline of
                  the vehicle, regardless of body style. For convertibles and roadsters, the
                  highest portion of the windshield frame will be considered the highest portion
                  of the roof; however, a convertible or roadster utilizing a hardtop will use the

                  Reinforcements to the wing mounting area may be used, but may serve no other
                  purpose. Body panels to which a wing mounts must remain functional (e.g., trunk
                  lids and rear hatches must open). Wing endplate surface area is limited to 200
                  sq. in. (1290.3 cm 2 ) each and limited to a maximum of two (2).

                <li>
                  Canards are allowed and may extend a maximum of 6.0" (152.4 mm) from the front
                  bodywork as viewed from above. No portion of the canard may extend past the
                  widest part of the front bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. Canard area will
                  be measured in the same manner as wings using Section 12. Canard area may not
                  exceed 15% of total wing allowance. The sum of canard area and rear wing area
                  may not exceed the total wing allowance. Fore and aft variance in curvature and
                  angle is open. Canards may have endplates. Canard endplate total surface area is

                  front bodywork as viewed from above. Splitters may not extend rearward past
                  the centerline of the front wheels. No portion of the splitter may extend beyond
                  the widest part of the front bodywork as viewed from above. Aerodynamically

              and the method used to attach it to the interface is unrestricted. Any
              actuation mechanism and the associated wiring, if any, may be removed.
              Vehicles utilizing alternate (non-OE) hardtops will be considered as open cars
