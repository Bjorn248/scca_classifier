          Category Objective
        </h3>
        <p>
        Street Modified allows competitors to modify vehicles using advanced fabrication and
        tuning with specific limitations. Street Modified provides the allowances of the
        lower-prep categories with the addition of major modifications to the drivetrain,
        suspension, and body as well as sophisticated aerodynamic components
        </p>
        <p>
        The purpose of this category is to serve as a membership recruitment and retention tool
        by providing a natural competition outlet for auto enthusiasts using streetable sport
        sedans equipped with drivetrain and suspension modifications that are beyond those
        allowed in the Street Prepared category. Cars identical to the US-market counterpart
        except for comfort and convenience modifications as allowed per Section 13.2.A.
        See Sections 3.8 and 8.3.1 for documentation requirements
        </p>
