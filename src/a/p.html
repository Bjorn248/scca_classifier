          17.2 BODYWORK AND STRUCTURE
The purpose of the following rules is to maintain recognizable external
features of the manufacturer’s make and model, while providing the necessary safety and performance modifications. Restrictions regarding external body shape and belly pans are aimed at preventing attempts to obtain ground effects or streamlining.
</br></br>A. The external shape of the body may only be changed where specifically
authorized. Standard window openings, rain gutters, or approved facsimiles shall be retained. All external trim and model identification may
be removed. Grilles may be removed, modified, or substituted.</br></br>B. Chassis, frame, or subframe may be reinforced provided components
and attachments are not relocated except where specifically permitted.
Reinforcing does not authorize the use of underbody or belly pans forward of the firewall or aft of the front edge of the rear wheel opening.
It is permitted to have jack points recessed into the rocker panels or to
have one tube per side extending downward through the bottom of the
door provided they do not extend beyond the overall width of the car or
in an unsafe or dangerous manner. No part of the bodywork or chassis,
to the rear of the front wheel opening, shall touch the ground when both
tires on the same side of the car are deflated.</br></br>C. The chassis, frame, or subframe may be notched or cut and brackets
may be added for the purpose of attaching alternate suspension, steering, or drivetrain components except that the firewall may not be modified for engine block or cylinder head clearance. Holes may be cut to
provide clearance for authorized suspension, steering, and drivetrain
components through their entire range of travel. Clearance between
the modified chassis, frame, or subframe and the suspension, steering,
and drivetrain components is not to exceed 4.0&#34; (101.6 mm). Additional
structure may be added in order to attach allowed components to the
chassis. Relocation, notching, or cutting of the chassis, frame, or subframe for tire clearance or moving the wheels inboard is not allowed.
Replacement of inner fenders or wheel wells to enable wider wheels and
tires is allowed.</br></br>D. Replacement of any chassis component (e.g., subframe) in its entirety
by one of alternate construction, unless specifically permitted, in Appendix A, shall result in the vehicle being &#34;in excess&#34; of these rules
which will invoke Section 17.11 weight adjustments.</br></br>E. The floor in the driver/passenger compartment may be modified for installation of subframe connectors, exhaust components, battery boxes,
ballast weights, and drivetrain clearance. For the same reasons listed,
the rear seat floor area, defined as the area extending rearward from the
back of the driver’s seat to the trunk and between the frame rails, may
be removed, modified, or replaced. The driver/passenger compartment
must remain separate from any exhaust and drivetrain components by
a metal panel. Trunk floors may be modified, removed, or replaced. If
replaced, the trunk floor must be replaced with metal panels of similar
shape to the original. Removal of the trunk floor is allowable only when
a metal bulkhead separates the trunk area from the passenger compartment. The transmission tunnel may be modified for the purpose of installing a competition driver seat. The driver’s side floor pan may be

modified to accommodate larger/taller drivers. All modifications shall
be contained between the transmission tunnel, driver’s side rocker, rear
bulkhead and no more than 30&#34; forward of the rear bulkhead. The modification shall not extend below the factory floor stiffener/frame rail.
The steel used in the modification shall be no thinner than .058&#34;. All
modifications shall be welded in place. This modification shall serve no
other purpose other than seating position.</br></br>F. The firewall may be notched or recessed for clearance of exhaust headers, electric lines, coolant lines, oil lines, oil sumps not attached directly
to the engine block, fuel-carrying lines, fuel pumps, intercooling piping, carburetors, air horns, air cleaners, and distributor. Any material
added to the firewall must be either steel or aluminum. This requires a
sealed firewall between engine and passenger compartment. This rule
is for driver’s safety. Completely sealing all firewall openings is strongly
encouraged, but no gap may be larger than ⅛ inch (0.125&#34;,3.2 mm),
except around dynamic devices extending through the firewall (e.g.,
throttle linkage, transmission linkage, or other mechanical devices)
and should be sealed to the extent that functioning of the device is not
impaired. No more than 8.0&#34; (20.3 cm) clearance is allowed between
modified firewall areas and above listed components. The engine block,
cylinder head, turbochargers, and/or superchargers may not intrude
into the clearance areas authorized herein.</br></br>G. Bumper components not integral to the bodywork may be modified,
substituted with a replica of alternate material, or removed provided all
projecting hardware is also removed. Bumper bracket holes in the bodywork may be covered provided such covering serves no other purpose.
Bumper fascias integral with the bodywork may be modified or substituted with a replica of alternate material. Internal bumper components
may be removed, replaced, or modified. Modified or replica bumpers/
fascias must be of similar shape as standard components, completely
cover the area of the OE bumper/fascia, and not confuse the identity of
the vehicle.</br></br>H. All interior trim, dash boards, gauges, floor covering, carpet, upholstery
panels, and similar non-performance comfort or convenience items
may be removed or replaced.</br></br>I. The driver’s seat may be replaced with a seat of any origin. All passenger
seats may be removed or replaced with seats of any origin. The driver’s
seat must remain on the standard side of the car and may not cross the
centerline of the car. The seat may be relocated fore/aft by up to 12.0&#34;
(30.5 cm) based on the centerline of the original front and rear mounting points. Rear bulkhead of the driver/passenger compartment may
not be removed to relocate the seat and the driver’s seat may not extend
rearward past the bulkhead.</br></br>J. Doors may be lightened and may be replaced by ones of alternate ma
terials. Doors may be pinned, but not bolted, to prevent their opening
in case of an accident. Quick release fasteners (e.g., Dzus fasteners) are
allowed. Standard door hinges and latch mechanisms may be removed,
but the doors shall be capable of being opened or removed. Interior
door panels may be removed or replaced and the door window slots
may be covered. Alternate attachment devices may be added to hood
and deck lid to supplement or replace the latches. Hood and deck lid
hinges may be removed.</br></br>K. Windows<div class="indent"></br>1. All windows may be replaced with polycarbonate material. The front
windshield shall have a minimum thickness of ⅛ inch (0.125&#34;, 3.16
mm). Tinting of the upper portion of the front windshield and the
entire portion of all other windows is allowed. All window replacements shall remain in the same position in the frame or opening as
the original glass it replaces; rubber molding is optional.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. All window channels and window winding mechanisms may be removed.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Closed cars:</br> All side window glass may be removed. All rear hatchbacks and deck lids shall be completely closed; poor alignment of
bodywork or any other means to prevent complete closure is not permitted.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Open cars:</br> All windows and windshields (including windshield
frames) may be removed. The resulting window slots may be covered.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. The installation of windshield safety clips, rear window safety straps,
and windshield safety straps is permitted.</div></br></br>L. The contour of the fender may be altered (flared) for tire clearance
provided the modifications do not confuse the identity of the car. Only
standard production ventilation openings on the specific recognized
model are permitted. Tires may extend beyond the bodywork. Fender
wheel openings may be trimmed to provide tire clearance throughout
the full range of suspension travel, but no more than is necessary for
this purpose.</br></br>M.Inner fender panels separating the wheel wells from the engine compartment may be altered, replaced, or removed. Rear inner fender
panels may be altered, replaced, or removed provided there are panels
providing total separation between driver/passenger compartment and
wheels. A shock/strut tower integral to the inner fender panel is considered part of the inner fender panel and is included in this allowance.
This does not allow modification of frame/frame stubs beyond Section
17.2.C.</br></br>N. Replacement, addition, or removal of accessories (gauges, switches, indicators, etc.), or other interior modifications for driver convenience, or

to permit installation of required safety equipment, is authorized provided such modifications have no influence whatever on the mechanical
performance of the car. Such modifications do not include the substitution or replacement of any bodywork or chassis component except
those specifically authorized by these rules.</br></br>O. The standard OE front spoiler or a non-standard front spoiler/splitter
may be used. If a non-standard front spoiler/splitter is used it must
comply with the following requirements:</br> Shall be installed parallel to
the ground (within ±3° fore and aft) and may extend a maximum of 6&#34;
(15.24 cm) forward of the frond bodywork/fascia as viewed from above.
Splitters may not extend rearward past the centerline of the front
wheels. No portion of the splitter may be wider than/extend beyond the
widest part of the front bodywork/fascia from a vertical line drawn at
the center of the front axles forward on the vehicle. The splitter and canards may have endplates. The endplates may connect the splitter and
the canard. The splitter and canard endplate total surface area is limited to 100 sq. in. (645.2 cm2) for each side. Canards are allowed and
may extend a maximum of 6&#34; (15.24 cm) forward of front bodywork/
fascia as viewed from above. No portion of the canard may extend past
the widest part of the front bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. Canard area will be measured in the same manner as wings using Section
12.10. Canard area may not exceed 1.2 sq. ft. (1114.8 cm²). Openings are
permitted for the purpose of ducting air to the brakes, radiator, and/
or oil cooler(s); equal openings may be placed in the standard lower
front panel directly behind openings placed in the spoiler/splitter. The
spoiler/splitter may not function as a wing. This allows a vertical airdam/spoiler above a horizontal splitter.</br></br>P. A spoiler or wing may be added to the rear of the car provided it complies with either of the following:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. It is a production rear spoiler or wing which is standard or optional
equipment of a US model of the vehicle or an exact replica in an alternate material.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. It is a non-production rear spoiler which is mounted to the rear portion of the rear hatch, deck, or trunk lid. The spoiler may extend no
more than 10.0&#34; (25.4 cm) from the original bodywork in any direction. Alternatively in a hatchback, the spoiler may be mounted to the
rear hatch lid at or near the top of the hatch in such a configuration
the spoiler may extend not more than 7½ inches (7.50&#34;, 19.1 cm)
from the original bodywork in any direction. The spoiler may be no
wider that the bodywork. The use of endplates is prohibited. Spoiler
endplates are defined as any vertical (or semi-vertical) surfaces attached in front of the spoiler which have the result of capturing and
redistributing air (downforce) along all or any portion of the spoiler.
The angle of attack is free. The spoiler may not function as a wing.
</div><div class="indent"></br>3. For Classes XP, DP, EP and FP, wings may be added, removed, or
modified. OE or non-OE spoilers must be removed. Non-OE wings
may only be attached to the chassis or body behind the centerline of
the rear axle. The total combined surface area of all wings shall not
exceed 8 sq. ft. (0.7432 m2) as calculated per Section 12. The number of wing elements is limited to 2. Wings designed to be adjustable while the car is in motion must be locked in a single position.
Spoilers under 17.2.P and rear wings are mutually exclusive such
that a builder may use one or the other, but not both. Wings, and
any component thereof, may not extend beyond the vehicle width
as defined by the outermost portion of the vehicle doors, less mirrors, door handles, rub strips, and trim. In addition, no portion of the
wing or its components may be more than 6&#34; (15.24 cm) forward of
the rear axle, more than 0&#34; (0.0 mm) beyond the rearmost portion of
the bodywork, or more than 6&#34; (15.24 cm) above the roofline of the
vehicle, regardless of body style. Reinforcements to the wing mounting area may be used, but may serve no other purpose. Wing endplate surface area is limited to 200 sq. in. (1290.3 cm2) each and the
number of endplates is limited to a maximum of 2. For convertibles/
roadsters with no roof and targas with no rear window, no portion of
the wing may be higher than 12&#34; (30.48 cm) above the highest point
of the body that is behind the centerline of the rear axle. In the event
that a convertible/roadster with no roof or a targa-top with no rear
window retains the OE windshield frame with a windshield of any
material that meets Section 17.2.K.1, the top of the windshield frame
shall be considered the top of the roofline and the car may use the
wing mounting rules in Appendix A.1.c for a closed car.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Vehicles equipped with an OE rear wing may add a rear spoiler only
if the OE wing and wing attachments are first removed.</div></br></br>Q. The fuel tank may be modified, replaced, or relocated. If the fuel tank is
modified or replaced, the following restrictions apply:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. The fuel tank/cell may be located within the same area as the OE
tank.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. If the fuel tank/cell does not fit within the same area as the OE tank,
the requirements of Section 3.3.3.B.27 must be met.</div></br></br>R. All mirrors and their associated mounting hardware may be removed or
replaced.</br></br>S. The hood, hatchback, deck lid, and fenders may be lightened or replaced
by ones of alternate material provided the shape is similar to the original
and does not confuse the identity of the vehicle. Factory bolt-on fenders
may be replaced in their entirety. Cars with non-removable fenders may
replace the front fender panels going forward from the foremost door
opening and the rear fender panels going rearward from the rearmost
door opening. Closed cars must not remove standard material above

the horizontal line placed at the lowest point of the. Prepared driver’s door window opening,
with the exception that OE removable panels (e.g., T-tops, targa tops,
sunroofs) may be removed or replaced with panels of alternate material provided that the dimensions of any replacement panel do not vary
from those of the original by more than 1.0&#34; (25.4 mm) in any direction.
The approval of alternate body panels does not authorize the use of underbody or belly pans forward of the firewall or aft of the front edge of
the rear wheel opening. Ground effect tunnels and/or attempts to gain
ground effects are also not authorized. Any such elements incorporated
in the otherwise approved components must be removed or disabled.
Front hoods and engine covers may be vented and/or louvered. The total
area for all vents/louvers on a vehicle front hood and/or engine cover
may not exceed 500 sq. in. (3225.8 cm²), unless provided as standard
equipment. The total area is measured as the total open area or the perimeter of the louvers when viewed from above.
The location, number, and shape of vents/louvers is unrestricted provided
they are fully contained on allowed panels. For vehicles having original
vents/louvers exceeding these dimensions, no further openings are permitted. Louver openings must face rearward and may stand no higher
than 1.0&#34; (25.4 mm) above the original surface. No additional scoops,
cowls, bulges, or ducts are permitted unless specified in Appendix A.</br></br>T. All headlights, front parking lights, and front signal lights may be removed. Headlight doors may be removed, replaced, or modified. Any

Prepared vehicles may make use of alternate engines from the engine
originally delivered, with the following rules. Excluded from use of alternate engines are forced-induction engines, hybrid engine and drivetrains, and Prepared Limited Preparation Vehicles.<div class="indent"></br>1. Alternate engines are to be from the same make as the make of the
vehicle. Engine must be available in production automotive model(s)
sold in the US. No alternate engines or parts of the engine are allowed that were offered in other markets than the US unless listed
in Appendix A. Motorcycle, snowmobile, marine, or other engines of
non-automotive design are not permitted.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Vehicle manufacturers that no longer exist may use any motor available in the use from corporate brands or via the following listings:</br>
a. British makes may use Ford motors including Mazda.
b. Italian makes may use Fiat Chrysler motors.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Alternate engines are to retain the same piston or rotor count or less
as the vehicle’s engine was originally configured. Models classed with
multiple piston counts on the same line may use any piston count
that matches classed models.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Alternate engines must keep same cooling type as before. Examples:</br>
Air cooled stays air cooled and water cooled stays water cooled.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Alternate engine weights will be calculated using listed engine displacement of swapped engine.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Alternate engines may make use of allowances found in 17.10
The engine orientation (transverse stays transverse and longitudinal
stays longitudinal) and the engine bay location must not be changed

(front-engine stays front-engine, mid-engine stays mid-engine, and
rear-engine stays rear-engine).</div></br>7. Piston engine vehicles may not substitute rotary engines and vise
versa

        <h3>
          17.11 OTHER</br></br>A. Vehicles prepared in excess of Solo® allowances and prepared up to
either the current Club Racing GT or Production Category rules are permitted to compete in X Prepared (XP) class. Tube-frame production
cars and kit-cars specifically listed in Appendix A (i.e., Shelby Cobra) are
subject to the requirements in the relevant Appendix. Tube-frame versions of production vehicles (e.g., a tube-frame Mazda RX-7) are considered in excess of the rules and must comply with the requirements
in this Section. Section 17.8.B.5 minimum track requirements apply.
Minimum weight will be GCR minimum plus any Solo® weight adjustments (wheel size weight increases, etc.). Vehicles taking advantage of
this allowance may only use the Club Racing GCR (General Competition Rules) allowances in whole. Cars which are not listed in the GCR
may not use this allowance and are limited to the modifications allowed
in Section 17. For those cars which have been de-listed from the current
year GCR, the appropriate specifications will be developed and added
to Appendix A upon member request. An exception to the GCR will be
that open cars are permitted provided they comply with all provisions
of Section 17 pertaining specifically to open cars. The following items
listed in the GCR, while recommended, are not required:</br> Logbooks, annual inspections, roll cage, on-board fire systems, hand-held fire extinguisher, scattershield/chain guards, master switch, steering wheel lock
removal, window safety net, windshield safety clips and rear window
safety straps, and braided steel brake lines. Single Inlet Restrictor (SIR)
is not required. Due to the extent of modifications permitted on GT-derived cars classed within the Prepared category, it is possible for a replica car to meet the legality requirements for the corresponding original
model provided that the engine, track, and wheelbase remain within the
allowed specifications. In such a case, the replica is considered compliant for Prepared, provided it correctly meets all of the applicable GCR
specifications.</br></br>B. Weight Calculations
Where there is a percentage addition as well as a specific weight addition, the percentage is added to the base weight before the specific
weight addition. Examples:</br>
• In Prepared class X (XP), the minimum weight for an AWD car with
a 2.5L turbocharged engine is:</br><div class="indent"></br>2.5L x 1.4 = 3.5L x 250 lbs. = 875 lbs. + 1200 lbs. = 2075 lbs.</div></br></br>C. Data acquisition/recording systems are permitted.
</br></br>D. Except where there are specific requirements in these rules, any safe
line for fuel, hydraulic fluids, oil, water or breather is allowed.</br></br>E. Ballast may be added to all cars as required to meet minimum weight
provided it is securely mounted within the bodywork and serves no other purpose. Ballast plates may be installed beneath the floor pan so long
as they do not protrude beyond its edges.</br></br>F. All cars may have towing eyes, hooks, or straps which do not dangerously protrude from the bodywork.</br></br>G. Removal of or modification to heating, ventilation, air conditioning,
wiper/washer, audio, security, communication, and convenience systems is allowed provided the modification does not serve another purpose (e.g., an air conditioning compressor may not be modified to serve
as a supercharger).
