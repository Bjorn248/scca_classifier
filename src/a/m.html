          18.1 MODIFIED PRODUCTION-BASED CARS</br></br>A. Eligibility
Modified classes D (DM) and E (EM) contain production-based cars
which are permitted additional modifications beyond those allowed in
Prepared classes CP through FP. Models must meet the requirements
of Section 13 (first paragraph), be specifically listed in Appendix A, meet
the specifications below, or be otherwise recognized by the SEB.<div class="indent"></br>1. Kit Cars
Kit cars, which were originally designed, constructed, and licensable
for street use, may participate in DM and EM if they are approved
by the SEB. Members desiring approval of a particular kit car should
provide the SEB with detailed information regarding the kit model
and contact info, if available, for the OE manufacturer. For obsolete
kit cars, the member will be expected to provide construction specifications, dimensions, and photographs for the SEB to examine and
keep on file. The SCCA® will evaluate each submitted kit model individually and the evaluation will ensure that the specific model:</br>
a. Follows current DM and EM allowances regarding minimum floor

pan dimensions (see Section 18.1.C.1).
b. Has no unusually advantageous aerodynamic features.
c. Has no exceptionally low center of gravity.
d. Has no exceptionally high strength-to-weight ratio.
e. Has no other unique features that would upset the competitive
balance in DM and EM.
f. Has independently-verifiable evidence of at least 10 examples
which meet the approved specification produced. Extremely limited production sports racer-type efforts are discouraged.
Constructed examples of approved kits are subject to the following:</br>
g. They will be allowed all, but no more than, the modifications that
production-based cars are permitted, with the exception that minimum width for all kit cars shall be no less than 65&#34; (165.1 cm) as
measured at the narrower end of the car at the tire outer sidewalls
with a minimum 14 psi of tire pressure.
h. They are subject to the same engine and transmission restrictions
as production-based cars.
i.They must meet the same safety requirements as production-based
cars.
j. They must compete with full standard bodywork and that body
must remain recognizable as that of the approved make and model. For these purposes, the chassis of exoskeleton type cars is considered part of the bodywork.
A newly-added model is not eligible for the current year’s Solo® National Championships unless its listing was published no later than
the July issue of the official SCCA® publication.
The list of currently approved models is as follows:</br>
• Exomotive Exocet
• Factory Five Racing 818 (S &amp; R)
• Sylvia Sports Cars J15
• DF Goblin</div><div class="indent"></br>2.Clones
Clones/replicas of SCCA®-recognized production cars are permitted
to compete in DM and EM provided they comply with the following
requirements:</br>
a. They are substantially similar to and recognizable as the original
manufactured vehicle on which they are based.
b. Their specifications do not violate any rule stated herein.
c. A clone shall not benefit from kit car manufacturer &#34;running
changes&#34; unless those changes have also been submitted and ap
proved.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Other Models
The Panoz Roadster and Porsche 550 Spyder are eligible for competition in DM and EM.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Specifications
Weight and displacement specifications are as shown in Appendix A.</div></br></br>B. Bodywork<div class="indent"></br>1. Respecting Section 18.1.F:</br> Aerodynamic Aids, bodywork may be
modified beyond the allowances of Section 17.2; however, the shape
of the body must remain recognizable as that of the approved make
and model. The body must be made of a fire resistant material.
Doors, hoods, trunk lids, sunroofs, hatchbacks, etc. need not function as originally designed. Bumpers, grilles, lights, glass, and trim
may be removed. Side mirrors and tail/stop lights are not required.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Firewalls and floors shall prevent the passage of flame and debris to
the driver compartment. For cars having fluid lines in a non-standard routing over the belly pan, the belly pan shall have drain holes
to prevent the accumulation of fluids.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. The driver must be provided with clear and unobstructed access to
the driver’s compartment.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Interiors may be gutted. The driver’s seat must be securely mounted.
Steering and driver seating must be completely to the left or right of
the vehicle longitudinal centerline. The seat must be mounted such
that no part of the driver’s body below the waist may cross the longitudinal centerline of the car.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Body panels may be altered and air ducting installed to accommodate the installation of the water radiator. If the radiator encroaches
into the driver compartment, it must be separated from the driver by
a metal bulkhead or enclosing container.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Hoods may be altered to allow for induction system changes without
restriction. Such alterations shall serve no other purpose.</div></br></br>C. Body and Frame
		 a. Vertical features above the bottom floor pan plane do not have to
satisfy original minimum size or shape. Note that the original width
and length of the floor pan still have to meet the original dimensions.
Drivetrain tunnels and seat mounting platforms may be made smaller than standard. A flat floor pan is legal.
b. Floor pan material, thickness, and method of attachment are
open.
c. Rear passenger doors, if present, may be replaced with non-functional panels. Front and rear doors and door openings may be altered to accommodate compliant wheelbase changes.

d. All other cars, whose factory wheelbase are less than 93&#34; (236.2
cm) may still change their wheelbase, but it must be done without
violating the floor pan length as determined by both front and rear
factory bulkhead locations.<div class="indent"></br>3. Materials
a. Except as specifically authorized, ferrous metal (containing iron)
must be used for all primary load-bearing structures of the car.
The primary load bearing structure is the main tub or chassis and
its connections to the suspension. No aluminum cages or roll bars
are allowed. Any ferrous or aluminum alloy is permitted for suspension arms, location links, and uprights/spindles. Beryllium
and beryllium alloys are not allowed anywhere on the car.
b. The exceptions to the above are parts of the donor production cars
that were originally non-metal. In all cases, replacement of these
parts or addition of more load bearing structure must be by metal.
c. Except as specifically authorized, lightweight substitute materials
such as carbon fiber are permitted only so long as they are clearly
not load bearing in the primary structure or the suspension. For
example, outer body panels in the central tub region must be attached in a flexible manner such as with Dzus® fasteners if nonstandard material composition or non-standard material thicknesses are to be used.</div></br></br>D. Drivetrain<div class="indent"></br>1. Engines must be derived from production automobiles available in
the US or elsewhere. Complete race engines derived from production automobile block designs such as the Pontiac® Super Duty 4
and the Cosworth® 16-valve series are allowed. Motorcycle, UTV,
ATV, side-by-side, snowmobile, marine, or any other initially nonautomobile design is not allowed even if it was also made available
in an automobile. Non-automobile engines are prohibited. 4-stroke
automobile motors shall not be converted to 2-stroke.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Engine and/or drivetrain changes are permitted within the following
limitations:</br>
a. Original front-engine design must remain a front-engine design
(i.e., no part of the engine block or cylinder head may extend rearward of the midpoint of the wheelbase).
b. Original rear- or mid-engine designs may be interchanged with
each other, but no part of the engine block or cylinder head may
extend forward of the midpoint of the wheelbase.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Non-automobile CVTs are prohibited. Automobile-based CVTs are
only allowed with their matching factory engine.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Internal and external components of the engine, transmission, and
rear differential are unrestricted. Any shifting mechanism or pattern

is permitted. Driveshafts may be made of any material deemed safe.
Supercharging and turbocharging are permitted without restriction
but shall require the displacement specifics of Section 18.0.B.3.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Supercharging and turbocharging are permitted for all engines subject to the displacement factor of 18.B. In DM, such induction systems must have a restrictor on the inlet side of the turbo/supercharger. All inducted air must pass through this restrictor which must be
constructed of metallic material. The minimum orifice (choke) of the
restrictor shall be no greater than 33 mm (1.3&#34;). The restrictor passage may be shaped fore and aft of the choke region. The restrictor choke region must be made of one piece without moving parts.
Inlet restrictor must be mounted within 18&#34; of turbo inlet. Tubing
between the restrictor and turbo/supercharger inlet must be rigid
and made from non expanding parts. The tubing inside diameter
may not exceed 3&#34; at any point. Flexible couplers may be used for
connections.</div></br></br>E. Minimum Weights
Minimum weights for cars in DM and EM and all adjustments to these
weights are shown in Appendix A.</br></br>F. Aerodynamic Aids<div class="indent"></br>1. These classes are restricted downforce classes. No aerodynamic tunnels, or sealing skirts may be added. No bargeboards, ramps, or other aerodynamic devices are allowed except as specified herein or as
part of an SCCA®-approved GT-1 bodywork package for the specific
make and model.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. The hood, tub, roof, rear fenders, and rear deck are not permitted
to be reshaped to achieve downforce. The front of the car may be
reshaped to accommodate the construction of spoilers, air dams,
and splitters, and may be widened to rear body width as specified
in Section 18.1.E.3.c below. Ramps joining the front fender flares to
the splitter/spoiler/airdam assembly which are included as part of a
SCCA®-approved GT-1 front bodywork package are allowed.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Front Aero
a. The standard OE or a non-standard front spoiler or air dam may
be used. A non-standard front spoiler is not permitted to protrude
forward beyond the overall outline of the car as viewed from above
or aft of the forward most part of the front fender opening and
shall not be mounted more than 4.0&#34; (101.6 mm) above the horizontal centerline of the front wheel hubs.
b. The spoiler may cover the normal grille opening at the front of
the car. Cooling duct openings are permitted. If the front radiator
is removed or relocated, no aerodynamic use of the unobstructed
front radiator pathway may be made. The front spoiler may be at
tached to the original bodywork or it may replace the bodywork it
would otherwise cover.
c. The front spoiler may not be wider than either the front or rear
bodywork, measured as the maximum distance between the
outside edges of the wheel well openings or fender flares at axle
height. The total fore-to-aft curvature or deviation of the rear
spoiler, measured at the trailing edge, shall not exceed 10.0&#34;
(254.0 mm) as viewed from above. The front spoiler must be connected to bodywork above the spoiler across its full width. New
bodywork may be added to close the gaps between the fenders,
nose, and spoiler/splitter/airdam assembly on cars with open or
irregular front bodywork such as the Ford® Model T, MG® TD,
Morgan®, and Lotus® 7. When these or similar vehicles use a
full-width front spoiler, the car’s spoiler/airdam is required to be
vertical (between 80-100°) for the lower 8.0&#34; (20.3 cm) of its extent. The change in top view outline caused by these bodywork
changes is allowed.
d. Front splitters are allowed but must be installed parallel to the
ground within ±1.0&#34; (±25.4 mm) fore to aft. The splitter trailing
edge must be fully sealed to the front bodywork/fender flair/spoiler and the splitter may not get wider as it extends forward. From
each point on its trailing edge the splitter can extend no more than</div><div class="indent"></br>8.0&#34; (15.2 cm) directly forward of the top-view outline of the car.
The splitter must be a single plane with the top and bottom surfaces parallel, with an overall height of 1.0&#34; (24.5 mm) or less. The
leading edge of the splitter may be rounded (the radius area may
extend backwards no more than the splitter thickness). The bottom of the splitter may attach to the belly pan but is not required
to do so.
Splitter endplate mounting location may be at the outside lateral
end or inboard of the outside lateral end of the splitter. Additional
mounting plates or strakes may be added inboard of the endplates
but these must be no larger than the endplates.
e. A front splitter and its associated features shall not function as a
diffuser.
f. An OE splitter which does not conform to these requirements may
be used unmodified on the original make and model.
g. Canards are allowed and may extend a maximum of 6&#34; (15.24
cm) forward of front bodywork/fascia as viewed from above.
No portion of the canard may extend past the widest part of
the front bodywork/ fascia as viewed from above. Canard area
will be measured in the same manner as wings using Section
12, Definitions. Canard area may not exceed 1.2 sq. ft. (1114.8
cm²). The canards may have endplates. The endplates may

connect the splitter and the canard. The splitter and canard
endplate total surface area is limited to 100 sq. in. (645.2
cm2) for each side.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. Rear spoilers
a. If a rear spoiler is used, it shall be mounted to the rear hatch, deck,
or trunk lid, and mount no further forward than the base of the
rear window. The spoiler extension for the entire spoiler is set by
one measurement at the lateral midpoint of the car. At that point,
the spoiler may not extend more than 10.0&#34; (25.4 cm) from the
attachment point out to the outer or free edge. This sets the maximum height above ground at all other locations on the spoiler.
The result may be a flat topped rather than contoured spoiler. Alternatively, the spoiler may be mounted at the rear of the roof,
or to the rear hatch lid at or near the top of the hatch; in such a
configuration the spoiler may extend no more than 7.5&#34; (19.1 cm)
from the original bodywork, measured as described above. The
spoiler angle of attack is free. The rear spoiler is measured from
leading, attached edge to trailing or outermost, free edge. Its measurement is independent of its angle of attack.
b. The spoiler may not be wider than the rear bodywork, measured
as the maximum distance between the outside edges of the wheel
well openings or fender flares at axle height. The total fore-to-aft
curvature or deviation of the rear spoiler, measured at the trailing
edge, shall not exceed 10.0&#34; (25.4 cm) as viewed from above.
c. Aerodynamic aids permitted in Section 18.1.F shall not function
as wings. Therefore, the spoiler may not overhang the bodywork
such that air passes both over and underneath it. If the rear spoiler overhangs the side of the car, the lower edge of the spoiler shall
be supported by bodywork that will prevent air from passing underneath the spoiler. This may be accomplished by extending the
spoiler to join the bodywork or wheel opening/fender flare beneath the overhang.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Diffusers are allowed at the rear of the car only; no part of the rear
diffuser shall cross the wheelbase centerline into the front half of the
vehicle. The diffuser may protrude rearward beyond the top view outline of the car. The diffuser shall have no more than 25.0&#34; (63.5 cm)
front to back of expanding chamber; this 25.0&#34; expansion chamber
length is inclusive of all parts/components/body forward and rearward of the diffuser. A diffuser is defined as an expanding chamber
between the vehicle and the ground for the purpose of accelerating
air ahead of it to develop low pressure. Vanes or strakes are allowed
inside the diffuser; sideplates and strakes may extend below the diffuser surface as long they do not attain a definite seal with the ground
on level ground. Closed undersides or belly pans (lower surface) are

permitted. The entire length of the underbody may be closed off to
permit proper airflow to a rear diffuser or to smooth the underside of
the car. The belly pan shall be flat within 1.0&#34; (25.4 mm) total deviation. No tunnels or other underbody aerodynamic features are permitted. Chassis rake is free. Additionally, no side skirt or body side,
etc., may extend more than 1.0 cm (0.394&#34;) below this lower surface
anywhere on the car to the rear of the front axle unless specifically
permitted by these rules.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. If a factory production car or kit car was supplied with tunnels they
may remain but they must be blocked in a safe manner to prevent
them from functioning to provide downforce. For example, foam or
sheet metal may be firmly attached in tunnels to ruin their shape or
to stop airflow.</div><div class="indent"></br>7. Vanes, strakes, and/or endplates (elements) are permitted on front
and rear spoilers. A minimum distance of 6.0&#34; (152.4 mm) must separate adjacent elements. These do not have to be square or rectangular; the side profile shape is open. For each element, the total area
may be no more than:</br>
• 56 sq. in. (362.9 cm²) for a roof spoiler;
• 100 sq. in. (645.16 cm²) for a trunk spoiler;
• 100 sq. in. (645.16 cm²) for a front splitter.</div><div class="indent"></br>8. Wings may be added, removed, or modified. Non-OE wings may
only be attached to the chassis or body behind the centerline of
the rear axle. The total combined surface area of all wings shall
not exceed 8 sq. ft. (0.7432 m2) as calculated per Section 18.0.C.,
Definitions. The number of wing elements is limited to 2. Wings
designed to be adjustable while the car is in motion must be
locked in a single position. Spoilers under 17.2.P and rear wings
are mutually exclusive such that a builder may use one or the
other, but not both. Wing endplate surface area is limited to 200
sq. in. (1290.3 cm2) each and the number of endplates is limited
to a maximum of 2. No part of the wing may extend past the
widest part of the car.</div></br></br>G.Brakes
The use of any type brakes, pads, and components are permitted (disc
or drum). The location of brake components (inboard vs. outboard)
may be changed from original. The original &#34;emergency&#34; or hand brake
may be removed.</br></br>H. Tolerances
A tolerance of ±½&#34; (±12.7 mm) shall be used when measuring floor pan
dimensions from the car’s original specifications.</br></br>I. Other<div class="indent"></br>1. At least 50% the width of each tire must be covered by the fenders,

for no less than 75% of the length of the tire, when viewed from the
top of the fender perpendicular to the ground. No sharp edges are
permitted.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Suspension systems and wheels are free.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. The use of a windscreen is not required.</div></br>4. Roll bar requirements for cars competing in DM and EM are as specified in Section 3.3.2.
