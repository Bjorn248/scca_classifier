                  the rear deck/hatch area behind the centerline of the rear axle. The total
                  combined surface area of all wings shall not exceed 8 sq. ft. (0.7432 m 2 ) as
                  calculated per the Wing Area 2021 SCCA® National Solo® Rules— 12116. Street
                  Modified Computation in Section 12. The number of wing elements is limited to
                  two (2).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wings, and any component thereof, may not extend beyond the vehicle width, as
                  defined by the outermost portion of the vehicle doors, less mirrors, door
                  handles, rub strips, and trim. In addition, no portion of the wing or its
                  components may be more than 6.0" forward of the rear axle, more than 0.0" beyond
                  the rear most portion of the bodywork, or more than 6.0" above the roofline of
                  the vehicle, regardless of body style. For convertibles and roadsters, the
                  highest portion of the windshield frame will be considered the highest portion
                  of the roof; however, a convertible or roadster utilizing a hardtop will use the
                  highest portion of the hardtop as the roofline.

                  Reinforcements to the wing mounting area may be used, but may serve no other
                  purpose. Body panels to which a wing mounts must remain functional (e.g., trunk
                  lids and rear hatches must open). Wing endplate surface area is limited to 200
                  sq. in. (1290.3 cm 2 ) each and limited to a maximum of two (2).

                <li>
                  Canards are allowed and may extend a maximum of 6.0" (152.4 mm) from the front
                  bodywork as viewed from above. No portion of the canard may extend past the
                  widest part of the front bodywork/fascia as viewed from above. Canard area will
                  be measured in the same manner as wings using Section 12. Canard area may not
                  exceed 15% of total wing allowance. The sum of canard area and rear wing area
                  may not exceed the total wing allowance. Fore and aft variance in curvature and
                  angle is open. Canards may have endplates. Canard endplate total surface area is

                  front bodywork as viewed from above. Splitters may not extend rearward past
                  the centerline of the front wheels. No portion of the splitter may extend beyond
                  the widest part of the front bodywork as viewed from above. Aerodynamically

              actuation mechanism and the associated wiring, if any, may be removed.

              the manufacturer. Minor repositioning of the headlights is allowed to
              accommodate the alternate headlight, but the unit may not be relocated and the
              repositioning may servce no other purpose. All associated hardware may be
