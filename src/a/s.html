          13.1 AUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS
If a modification is not specifically authorized in this or previous Sections
of these Rules, it is not allowed.
The addition of small holes for attachment hardware for authorized modifications is implicit (e.g., holes for fasteners to mount additional gauges,
holes for brackets to mount shock absorber remote reservoirs). However,
these holes may serve no other purpose.
All repairs must comply with factory-authorized methods and procedures,
or industry standard methods, as follows:</br> If the OEM does not provide
an appropriate method of repair, industry standard methods and procedures may be used. Such repairs may not result in a part or combination
of parts that provides a competitive advantage (e.g., significant change
to weight, suspension control, power, etc.) as compared to the standard
part(s). Competitors are strongly cautioned to use this allowance to make
common-sense repairs only.
Front bumpers, rear bumpers, body trim pieces and attachment points
may be reinforced to prevent or repair damage from hitting cones. Reinforcements that are not visible to the exterior of the car are allowed. Such
repairs and/or reinforcements may serve no other purpose.
It is not permitted to use non-compliant parts even if they have been set
to OE specifications.
Refer to Appendix F for past clarifications of these rules.

permitted. This does not allow driver’s seat substitutions, or the removal of &#34;tow hooks&#34; or &#34;tie-down loops.&#34; Delayed shutdown devices such
as the &#34;Turbo Timer,&#34; which perform no function while the car is in motion, are permitted. This does permit the installation of an additional
mirror (e.g., Wink®), but does not allow the removal of the original
mirror.</br></br>B. Data acquisition systems (including video cameras) and the accompanying sensors are allowed but may serve no other purpose during a run
than real-time display and data recording.</br></br>C. Hood straps or fasteners may be added.</br></br>D. Alternate steering wheels are allowed, provided the outside diameter
is not changed by more than one inch from the standard size. Steering
wheels with an integral airbag may not be changed.</br></br>E. Alternate shift knobs or paddles are allowed.</br></br>F. Spare tires, tools, and jacks may be removed. Any fastening hardware
and/or other pieces that can no longer be firmly secured in the absence
of the spare tire may be removed if necessary to ensure compliance with



Section 3.3.3.B.1, Safety Inspection Requirements.</br></br>G. Roll Bars and Roll Cages<div class="indent"></br>1. Roll bars and roll cages may be added. Roll bars may be welded
or bolted in. Roll bars must meet the requirements of section 3.3.2.
Standard rollover hoops, covers, trim panels interior parts and
rear seats may be removed or modified for clearance. Holes may
be added to the chassis to allow installation but may serve no other
purpose. Factory seatbelts and airbags must remain fully functional once the roll bar is installed. The total weight of components removed must be less than the total weight of the components added
during installation. Competitors are strongly cautioned to make the
minimum amount of modification required to affix a given part and
to not make unduly tortured interpretations of this rule.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Roll cages may be added. It is strongly recommended that roll cages
be constructed according to the Club Racing GCR, though they must
be bolted (not welded) into the automobile and be contained within
the driver/passenger compartment. A roll cage has more than four
attachment points to the body or frame or has bracing both fore and
aft of the main hoop.</div></br></br>H. Driver restraints as outlined in Section 3.3.1 are allowed. Seats may not
be cut to allow for the installation of alternate seat belts or harnesses.
Passive restraint systems may disabled but may not be removed. Removeable seat headrests may be repositioned using the original mounting hardware only if the OE components permit it with no modifications. This includes removing a headrest and reinstalling it backwards.
A horizontal &#34;harness bar&#34; may be used as part of the installation hardware for allowed driver restraints provided it has no more than 2 attachment points to the chassis and is bolted at those locations. A C-type
harness bar may also be used. It may have 4 bolted attachment points to
the chassis (2 primary and 2 supporting connections to resist rotation).
Truss-type harness bars with more than two (2) attachment points are
not allowed.</br></br>I. Cars may add one rear trailer hitch. The resulting weight addition is
allowed. The hitch may serve no other purpose. Factory tie downs and
cosmetic pieces (e.g., diffusers) may be modified or removed to facilitate hitch installation. Complete or partial removal of the hitch is
allowed for competition, provided it does not result in a reduction in
weight compared to the unmodified standard configuration.</br></br>J. Tow bar brackets may be installed but may serve no other purpose.</br></br>K. Any item that cannot be held permanently in place by factory-installed
fasteners may be removed.

        <h3>
          13.5 SHOCK ABSORBERS/STRUTS</br></br>A. The make of shock absorbers, struts, and strut housings may be substituted providing that the number, type (e.g., tube, lever, etc.), system
of attachment and attachment points are not altered, except as noted
below. The interchange of gas and hydraulic shocks absorbers is permitted. The following restrictions apply:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. No more than 2 (two) separate external shock damping adjustment
controls are allowed. This permits the use of shocks which originally came with more than two external adjustments, which have been
converted to double-adjustables, only if the additional adjustment
controls have been permanently disabled (e.g., via welding, epoxying,
grinding off). Gas pressure adjustment is not considered a damping
adjustment.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. Suspension geometry and alignment capability, not including ride
height, may not be altered by the substitution of alternate shock absorbers. Aftermarket strut housings are allowed provided that they
meet the Street category shock requirements defined herein (i.e., that
no suspension geometry changes result). This includes the position



of the steering arm attachment point in the case of struts with integrated steering arms.</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Adjustable spring perches are allowed, but the spring loadbearing
surface must be in the same location relative to the hub as on the
standard part. Shims may be used to achieve compliance.</div><div class="indent"></br>4. The fully extended length must be within ±1&#34; (±25.4 mm) of the dimension of the standard part.</div><div class="indent"></br>5. Electronically controlled shocks may not be used on vehicles that
did not have an option for them from the manufacturer. A full option package upgrade, including OE electronics and other comonents,
could be completed to add electronic shocks if they were not installed
from the manufacturer.</div><div class="indent"></br>6. Vehicles equipped with electronic shocks can replace them with nonelectronically-controlled shocks subject to Sections 13.5 and 13.9. Devices may be added to satisfy the ECU that the OEM shocks are still
installed; such devices may perform no other function.</div><div class="indent"></br>7. On cars with available electronically-controlled shocks, aftermarket
electronic shocks may be substituted but may only be controlled by
an OE shock control unit and may not contain independent or additional control logic within the shock itself. No additional electronic
modifications can be made to facilitate the installation of aftermarket
electronic shocks, and the OE controller may not be modified or reprogrammed.</div><div class="indent"></br>8. Vehicles in Super Street class (SS) originally equipped with an adaptive ride control system (MSRC, MRC, PASM, AMS, etc.) may alter
the calibration using an OEM-provided re-flash or the entire controller may be replaced. The calibration or replacement controller may
not perform any function not present in the OE controller. OEM
shock/strut bodies and internals must remain unaltered. Additional
sensors are not allowed. No modifications to the wiring harness are
allowed.</div></br></br>B. The mounting hardware shall be of the original type. The use of any
shock absorber bushing material, including metal, is permitted. Pressed
or bonded bushings may be removed from standard parts to facilitate
the use of alternate bushings which fit in the original location without
alterations to the part. This does not permit the use of an offset shock
bushing. A shock absorber bushing may be implemented as a spherical
bearing. The bushing attaching the end of a strut to the body or frame
on a strut type suspension is a suspension bushing, not a shock bushing.
For cars with a bayonet/shaft-type upper shock mount, this allowance
permits the removal of the shock bushing from the upper mounting
plate (e.g., drilling, cutting, burning out the bushing) and replacing it
with another bushing. This also includes shock bushings located in con


trol arms, etc. This does not allow other modifications to the plate itself
or use of an alternate plate.</br></br>C. To facilitate the installation of commonly available aftermarket shock
absorbers, struts, or strut inserts whose shaft size is larger than the center hole of an upper shock mount assembly, that hole may be enlarged
by the minimum necessary to accommodate the shock shaft size, provided the following restrictions are met:</br><div class="indent"></br>1. The enlarged hole must remain concentric with the original configuration.</div><div class="indent"></br>2. The enlargement of the hole does not require modification of a bearing (as opposed to a washer, sleeve, or plate).</div><div class="indent"></br>3. Neither the hole enlargement nor the location of the shock shaft
changes any alignment parameter. Provided these constraints are
met, this permits enlarging of the center hole in an upper shock
mount with an integrated rubber bushing, where the bushing is integral to the mount and bonded to the plate and the mount is provided
by the OEM as an assembly. This includes drilling out and/or removal
of the metal sleeve.</div></br></br>D. A suspension bump stop is considered to be performing the function
of a spring. Therefore, the compressed length of the shock at the initial point of contact with the bump stop may not be increased from
the standard part, although the bump stop may be shortened. Bump
stops installed externally and concentric with the shaft of a shock may
be drilled out to fit a larger diameter shock shaft. Bump stops may be
substituted provided they meet the length requirements and are in the
same location as stock.</br></br>E. A hole may be added through the bodywork to route the reservoir and
hose to a remote mounting location. Such holes may serve no other purpose.</br></br>F. A hole may be added to interior body panels, the engine compartment,
the trunk, and/or a strut bar to provide access to the adjustment mechanism on a shock absorber. The hole may serve no other purpose and
may not be added through the exterior body panels.

        <h3>
          13.8 SUSPENSION</br></br>A. Standard, as defined herein, suspension springs must be used. They
may not be cut, shortened, or collapsed. Spring perches may not vary
from the OE shape within the working part of the perch.</br></br>B. Both the front and rear suspension may be adjusted through their designed range of adjustment by use of factory adjustment arrangements
or by taking advantage of inherent manufacturing tolerances. This encompasses both alignment and ride height parameters if such adjustments are provided by the standard components and specified by the
factory as normal methods of adjustment. However, no suspension part
may be modified for the purpose of adjustment unless such modification is specifically authorized by the factory shop manual.</br></br>C. Suspension bushings, including but not limited to those which carry the
weight of the vehicle and determine ride height, may not be replaced
with bushings of a different material or dimension.</br></br>D. Replacement control arms for vehicles having integral bushing/arm assemblies must be standard manufacturer parts as per Sections 12 and
13.0.</br></br>E. If offered by the manufacturer for a particular model and year, the use
of shims, special bolts, removal of material to enlarge mounting holes,
and similar methods are allowed and the resulting alignment settings
are permitted even if outside the normal specification or range of specifications recommended by the manufacturer. If enlarging mounting
holes is specifically authorized but no material removal limits are specified, material removal is restricted to the amount necessary to achieve
the maximum factory alignment specification.

          13.9 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM</br></br>A. The make of spark plugs, points, ignition coil and high tension wires
is unrestricted including spark plug wires having an in-line capacitor.
Substitution or addition of ignition coil mounting brackets is permitted,
provided they affix to the original standard location and serve no other
purpose. (Modification of the distributor cap for the purpose of installing allowed non-standard components is not permitted.)</br></br>B. On cars made prior to January 1, 1968, any ignition system using a standard distributor without modification may be used.


</br></br>C. Ignition settings may not be adjusted outside factory specifications.</br></br>D. No changes are permitted to electronic engine management systems or
their programming.</br></br>E. Additional battery hold-down hardware may be added to supplement
the standard equipment in order to meet Section 3.3.3.B.18, Safety Inspections Requirements. It may serve no other purpose.</br></br>F. Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) may be disabled. Altering the
signal to the TPMS is permitted.</br></br>G. Use of alternate OEM ESC/TC modes are permitted so long as the alternate OEM modes are accessible though menus (e.g. &#34;dyno mode&#34;)
or driver-control inputs (e.g. button/pedal press sequences). Any resulting OBD codes or error lights are permitted.&#34;</br></br>H. Manufacturer authorized, vehicle-specific OEM ESC/TC software upgrades / updates are allowed; non-OEM modification of tables/algorithms/parameters is specifically prohibited. Modifications may serve
no other purpose.&#34;

          13.10 ENGINE AND DRIVETRAIN</br></br>A. The engine air filter element may be removed or replaced provided the
air flow path remains as originally designed (i.e., no additional openings). No other components of the air induction system may be removed, replaced, or modified.</br></br>B. Engines may be rebored to the manufacturer’s 1st standard overbore,
not to exceed 0.020&#34; (0.508 mm). Sleeving is allowed to repair to the
standard bore. Only OE-type standard or 1st overbore pistons of the
same configuration and of the same or greater weights are permitted.
No interchange between cast and forged pistons is allowed.</br></br>C. Any part of the exhaust system beyond (downstream from) the last
catalytic converter, if so equipped, may be substituted or removed provided the system exits the car in the original location and meets the requirements of Section 3.3.3.B.16, Section 3.5 and Appendix I where applicable. Vehicles equipped with exhausts that exit in multiple locations
may change to a single outlet in any of the original locations. Stainless
steel heat exchangers are permitted only if the physical dimensions and
configuration remain unchanged.
Modifications of any type, including additions to or removal of, the
catalytic converters, thermal reactors, or any other pollution control
devices in the exhaust system are not allowed and the system must be
operable. Replacement catalytic converters must be OE if the vehicle
has not exceeded the warranty period as mandated by the EPA. Converters must be of the same type and size and used in the same location as the original equipment converter(s). This does not allow for a



high performance unit. If the vehicle has exceeded the warranty period,
replacement catalytic converters must be OE-type as per Section 13.0.
Exhaust hangers which are bolted or welded on the car are considered
part of the body and may not be changed or removed.</br></br>D. Any oil filter may be added if not originally equipped. Canister-type
oil filters may be replaced with a spin-on type filter using a minimum
amount of hardware and connecting lines.</br></br>E. The installation of fluid catch tanks, catch cans, or oil separators is allowed provided the function and performance of the system (e.g., PCV
system) is not altered.</br></br>F. Thermostats may be added or substituted. A thermostat is a device
which controls the passage of water.</br></br>G. Silicone replacement hoses are permitted as alternate components provided they meet the requirements of Section 13.0 with regard to size,
shape, location, and performance equivalence. Replacement induction
system air intake hoses must also match the standard part in stiffness,
contour, and internal wall texture.</br></br>H. Any oil or grease, including synthetic, is permitted.</br></br>I. Valve seats and guides in older engines originally designed for leaded
fuel may be only substituted with alternate components if the dimensions are the same as those of the standard components.</br></br>J. On cars equipped with computer-aided gear selection or &#34;skip-shift&#34;
features from the manufacturer, modifications to defeat the &#34;skip-shift&#34;
feature are permitted any may serve no other purpose.</br></br>K. On cars with electronically-controlled exhaust pipe valving downstream
of the catalytic converter, devices may be added to satisfy the PCM/
ECU the the OE component is still enstalled. Such devices shall perform
no other function.
