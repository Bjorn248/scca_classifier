          Rule: See section 14.2 of the rules for clarification, but unless modifications are explicitly
          permitted, they are not allowed. All Street Class allowances are also allowed in addition
          to the below items.
          Things that are allowed:
          <ul class="sansserif list">
            <li>
              Pedal cover kits and other interior cosmetic accessories may be added.
            </li>
            <li>
              "Dress-up" items such as chrome dipsticks and non-standard filler caps
              are permitted, provided they serve no other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The driver and front passenger seats may be replaced with the following restrictions.
              The seating surface must be fully upholstered. The top
              of the seat, or an attached headrest, may not be below the center of
              the driver’s head. The seat, including mounting hardware, must weigh
              at least 25 pounds and must be attached using the OE body mounting
              holes/studs. Additional mounting points may be added.
            </li>
            <li>
              Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, bolt-on front valance lips/
              spoilers, and fog lights (except those integral to a headlight or turn signal) may
              be removed. Rear wings may be removed so long as the vehicle
              retains any federally-mandated third brake light.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any steering wheel may be used. An alternate steering wheel assembly,
              including all mounting hardware which replaces an airbag-equipped
              wheel, is not required to have an airbag but must weigh at least as much
              as the standard assembly. An alternate steering wheel is not required to
              have a horn button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may be rolled to
              gain additional tire clearance. (The outer fender contour may not be
              changed.) Plastic and rubber wheel well splash shields may be modified for
              tire clearance and to accommodate a rolled inside fender lip.
              The modifications may serve no other purpose (e.g., air intake, etc). No
              other changes to the standard fenders or wheel wells are permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Addition of spoilers, splitters, rear wings, bumper covers, valances, side
              skirts, and non-functional scoops/vents is allowed provided that either:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  It is a production part which is standard or optional equipment of a
                  US model of the vehicle. (“Model” is defined in Section 12.)

                  Section 14
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is listed in the vehicle manufacturer’s US accessory catalog for that
                  vehicle for normal highway use. This does not allow for parts sold
                  through a manufacturer’s performance catalog (e.g., Ford Racing,
                  HPD, Mazdaspeed, Mopar Performance, Mugen, NISMO, SPT, TRD,
                  etc).
                </li>
              </ol>
              Parts must be installed as directed by the manufacturer. Exact replicas,
              including weight, from alternate sources are also permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strut bars per Section 12 are permitted with all types of suspension,
              subject to the following constraints:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted,
                  but only with another 2-point strut bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or substituted;
                  substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point
                  strut bar. The connection to the chassis (e.g., firewall, bulkhead)
                  must be in the standard location.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension
                  pickup point locations on the chassis within 2” (50.8mm) in any direction of the actual suspension attachment to the chassis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Except for standard parts, no connections to other components are
                  permitted.
                </li>
              </ol>
              Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts. Only “bolt-on” attachment is permitted. Interior trim panels may be modified to allow
              installation of strut bars. Holes or slots may be no larger than necessary
              and may serve no other purpose. This does not permit any modifications to the frame or unibody beyond the allowed mounting holes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Longitudinal (fore-aft) subframe connectors (“SFCs”) are permitted
              with the following restrictions:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  They must only connect previously unconnected boxed frame rails
                  on unibody vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each SFC must attach at no more than 3 points on the unibody (e.g.,
                  front, rear, and one point in between such as a seat mount brace or
                  rocker box brace).
                </li>
                <li>
                  SFCs must be bolted in place and not welded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cutting of OE subframes or floorpan stampings is permitted.
                  Drilling is permitted for mounting bolts only.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cross-car/lateral/triangulated connections directly between the
                  driver’s side and passenger’s side SFCs are permitted. Connections
                  to OE components such as tunnel braces or closure panels via bolts
                  are allowed and count as the third point of attachment. No alteration
                  to the OE components is permitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  SFCs may not be used to attach other components (including but
                  not limited to torque arm front mounts or driveshaft loops) and may
                  serve no other purpose.
                </li>
              </ol>

        Any part of the exhaust system beyond (downstream from) the last catalytic converter,

        thermal reactors, or any other pollution control devices in the exhaust system are not

        converter(s). This does not allow for a high performance unit. If the vehicle has exceeded
