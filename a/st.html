          Rule: See section 14.1 of the rules for clarification, but unless modifications are explicitly
          permitted, they are not allowed. This is in addition to everything allowed in Street Class.
          Things that are allowed:
          <ul class="sansserif list">
            <li>
              Pedal cover kits and other interior cosmetic accessories may be added. "Dress-up"
              items such as chrome dipsticks and non-standard filler caps are permitted, provided
              they serve no other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              The driver and front passenger seats may be replaced with the follow-ing restrictions.
              The seating surface must be fully upholstered. The top of the seat, or an attached
              headrest, may not be below the center of the driver’s head. The seat, including
              mounting hardware, must weigh at least 25 pounds and must be attached using the OE body
              mounting holes/studs. Additional mounting points may be added.
            </li>
            <li>
              Factory rub strips, emblems, mud flaps, bolt-on front valance lips/spoilers,
              and fog lights (except those integral to a headlight or turn sig-nal) may be removed.
              Rear wings may be removed so long as the vehicle retains any federally-mandated third
              brake light.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any steering wheel may be used. An alternate steering wheel assembly,
              including all mounting hardware which replaces an airbag-equipped wheel,
              is not required to have an airbag but must weigh at least as much as the standard
              assembly. An alternate steering wheel is not required to have a horn button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fenders may not be cut or flared but the inside lip may be rolled to gain
              additional tire clearance. (The outer fender contour may not be changed.)
              Plastic and rubber wheel well splash shields may be modi-fied for tire clearance
              and to accommodate a rolled inside fender lip. The modifications may serve no other purpose
              (e.g., air intake, etc). No other changes to the standard fenders or wheel wells are permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Addition of spoilers, splitters, rear wings, bumper covers, valances, side skirts,
              and non-functional scoops/vents is allowed provided that either:
              1. It is a production part which is standard or optional equipment of a
              US model of the vehicle. (“Model” is defined in Section 12.)
              2. It is listed in the vehicle manufacturer’s US accessory catalog for that vehicle
              for normal highway use. This does not allow for parts sold through a
              manufacturer’s performance catalog (e.g., Ford Racing, HPD, Mazdaspeed,
              Mopar Performance, Mugen, NISMO, SPT, TRD, etc).Parts must be installed as directed
              by the manufacturer. Exact replicas, including weight, from alternate sources are
              also permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strut bars per Section 12 are permitted with all types of suspension,
              subject to the following constraints:
              1. A 2-point strut bar may be added, removed, modified, or substituted,
              but only with another 2-point strut bar.
              2. A triangulated (3-point) strut bar may be removed, modified, or sub-stituted;
              substitution may be with either a triangulated or a 2-point strut bar.
              The connection to the chassis (e.g., firewall, bulkhead) must be in the standard
              location. 3. Lower suspension braces must be attached to the lower suspension pickup
              point locations on the chassis within 2” (50.8mm) in any di-rection of the actual
              suspension attachment to the chassis. 4. Except for standard parts, no connections
              to other components are permitted.Additional holes may be drilled for mounting bolts.
              Only “bolt-on” at-tachment is permitted. Interior trim panels may be modified to allow
              installation of strut bars. Holes or slots may be no larger than necessary and may
              serve no other purpose. This does not permit any modifica-tions to the frame or
              unibody beyond the allowed mounting holes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Longitudinal (fore-aft) subframe connectors (“SFCs”) are permitted with the
              following restrictions: 1. They must only connect previously unconnected boxed frame
              rails on unibody vehicles. 2. Each SFC must attach at no more than 3 points on the
              unibody (e.g., front, rear, and one point in between such as a seat mount brace or
              rocker box brace). 3. SFCs must be bolted in place and not welded. 4. No cutting of
              OE subframes or floorpan stampings is permitted. Drilling is permitted for mounting
              bolts only. 5. No cross-car/lateral/triangulated connections directly between the
              driver’s side and passenger’s side SFCs are permitted. Connections to OE components
              such as tunnel braces or closure panels via bolts are allowed and count as the third
              point of attachment. No alteration to the OE components is permitted. 6. SFCs may
              not be used to attach other components (including but not limited to torque arm
              front mounts or driveshaft loops) and may serve no other purp
