## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Bjorn248/scca_classifier/actions/workflows/build.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bjorn248/scca_classifier/actions/workflows/build.js.yml)

The idea behind this project is to make it easy to understand the SCCA Classifications rules.
Focusing mainly on Solo (Autocross) classifications in the beginning. Initial thought is a
turbo tax-esque interface that asks a series of questions and tries to determine your class based
on the answers. Also, an interactive visual representation of the classes might be useful. The
intention is to initially write a web application and then write a mobile application.

## Project Goals
* Completely static site, no backend server/API calls
* Written in vanilla HTML5, CSS, and Javascript - no heavy web frameworks (mainly so I can learn
web development)
* Is responsive so that it works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
* To simplify the SCCA rules so that anyone can answer a series of questions about their car and
know which class or classes they are eligible to compete in

## Local Development
To run this project locally, simply start a local webserver to host the files.
I prefer this simple python server.
```
python -m http.server
```

## Rules
This has been updated for the 2023 Solo (autocross) rules.
